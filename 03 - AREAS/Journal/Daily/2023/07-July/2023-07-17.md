## Discoveries

- Discovered a couple of new [[Actuarial Resources]] on [[03 - AREAS/Tools/Tools - Version Control/Github]]:
	- https://github.com/aaweaver-actuary/rocky
		-  [[Property Casualty]] [[loss reserving]] [[triangle]] class and [[reserve estimation methods]].
	- https://github.com/aaweaver-actuary/Triangle
		- `triangle` is a lightweight [[Python]] package for working with [[property-casualty]] [[loss development triangles]]. It is designed to be easy to use, with a simple [[API]] and minimal dependencies. It is also designed to be fast, with a focus on vectorized operations and efficient memory usage.
		- This package was mainly developed for use in my `rocky` loss reserve modeling package, but it can be used independently of `rocky` as well. Includes io methods and basic [[chain-ladder]] functionality as well.


- Researched [[Vite]], a next-generation [[Frontend]] tool for setting up a [[development environment]]
