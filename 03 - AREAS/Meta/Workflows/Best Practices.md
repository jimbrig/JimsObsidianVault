# Best Practices with Obsidian Workflows

## Utilize Templates

- Frontmatter
	- Date
	- Author
	- Tags
	- Aliases
	- Publish
	- CSS Styles

- Title from File Name

- Footer with Backlinks, etc.

## Searching

Utilize search to find notes


## Avoid "Orphan" Notes

- Link to other notes _from_ that note.
- Add a link _to_ the note you're creating _from_ other notes

## Review Regularly

- [Random note](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/obsidian-playbook/Obsidian+Plugins/Core+Plugins/Random+note)
- Be curious about your vault
- Create structure where you need it, and leave things unstructured if you don't

## Publish

## Personalize

- Create a default template for notes.
- Don't follow any one methodology strictly.
- Use as few vaults as possible.
- Don't create orphans.
- Regularly review your notes.
- Learn in public.
