- [iA Writer](https://github.com/Bluemoondragon07/iA-Writer-Fonts)
	- Especially `iA Serif`, it’s beautiful, enables fast reading, and the letter `Q` looks so elegant.
- [Spectral](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spectral?preview.size=19&preview.text=Once,%20there%20were%20dragons.%20When%20I%20was%20a%20boy.%20&preview.text_type=custom&query=spectral)
- [Readex Pro (Lexend)](https://github.com/ThomasJockin/readexpro) 
	- It is nearly as legible as a `serif` font. 
	- It’s also very prominent-looking. 
	- Great for headings and body text.
- [Courier Prime Sans](https://github.com/quoteunquoteapps/CourierPrimeSans) 
	- Cozy and Friendly - I think it’s pretty impressive that one font can evoke such…calmness. 
	- I like to use it for screenwriting.
- [Noto Serif](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif?preview.size=19&preview.text_type=paragraph)
	- Looks like a generic `serif` font. 
	- But it’s pretty, it’s clean, it’s easy to read. 
	- `Noto Serif JP` is also good for the same reasons.
- [UD Digi Kyokasho](https://github.com/Bluemoondragon07/UD-Digi-Kyokasho-Font)
	- A round font with hand-drawn charm. 
	- This used to be my main font.
