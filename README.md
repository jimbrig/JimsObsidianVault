## Background

[[Note taking]] is *building a relationship with a future version of yourself.* Notes record facts, quotes, ideas, events, and much more so they can eventually be used to make better decisions, create more interesting content, or find solutions to problems.

## Organization is Hard

The more precisely we know what to use a piece of information for, the more easily we can organize it.

The problem is, we put things into notes _because_ we don't know what we'll use them for. You write down a quote from a book because you could eventually use it in 1,000 different ways. You could use it to help you make a decision, or write an essay, or lift a friend’s spirit when they’re going through a tough time (and you might use it for all three). Same thing for writing down notes from a meeting, or thoughts about a new person you met.
