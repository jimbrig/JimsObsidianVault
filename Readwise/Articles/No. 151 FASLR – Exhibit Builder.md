# No. 151: FASLR – Exhibit Builder

## Highlights
- I wanted to make sure the user had the ability to fully customize their reports. Otherwise, static reports would limit the capabilities of FASLR and give users the urge to export things to Excel to make up for its shortcomings – something all too common with financial software. By enabling customization, I hope to not only drive long-term user engagement, but also to make the reserving experience as pleasant as possible.
