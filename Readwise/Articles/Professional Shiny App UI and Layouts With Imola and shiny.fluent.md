## Highlights
- With additional packages like {imola} and {shiny.fluent}, anyone can create professional Shiny app UIs with custom layout options.
- In this post, we’re going to cover {shiny.fluent} and {imola}. And we’ll show you how to create Shiny apps that will impress your team.
- shiny.fluent for a Professional Shiny UI
  {shiny.fluent} is a package developed by Appsilon to integrate Microsoft’s open-source Fluent UI components into Shiny applications. With this package, Shiny users are able to build applications with the look and feel of Microsoft’s user-friendly and elegant UI.
  Using {shiny.fluent} in your project is quite simple. The basic input arguments are similar to those in base Shiny and all components are well documented. In the shiny.fluent demonstration, you can explore a preview of almost every available widget – like a catalog or peoplepicker. You can explore and select the ones that better suit your needs, grab the code presented, and use it in your app.
- imola for CSS grid and flexbox for Shiny Apps
  {imola} is an R package developed by Pedro Silva, and is a great solution to incorporate CSS grid and flexbox into Shiny applications. And it does so in a straightforward way. This package comes with built-in templates for the most common layouts in app development, and with flexibility for users to incorporate custom templates.
  The goal of the {imola} package is to turn any container into a grid or flexbox container with minimal refactoring of the original code; It’s recommended for applications that need mobile support.
  To get familiar with {imola} there are a few recommended resources:
  Package repository
  Package vignette
  Templates demo
  Minimal reproducible examples
  R code for examples
- To showcase the integration between {shiny.fluent} and {imola}, let’s create an application to explore recent earthquakes. The data comes from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and covers all earthquakes registered from April 28 to May 28, 2022.
