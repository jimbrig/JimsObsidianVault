## Highlights
- Tools you need to keep your life organized
- To-do list — to keep your reminders, to-do’s, projects and backlog. Basically the rule is that non-time sensitive stuff that can be acted upon goes here. Example: discovery for a client and related to-do’s. And yes, this is somewhat time-sensitive, but bare with me here.
- Calendar — this tool should be used for time-sensitive events only, e.g., meetings or appointments. Most of us use this tool like that, but some may put an occasional reminder in it, or to-do to complete — don’t do that. The calendar is not a place to keep your to-do’s and reminders. The to-do app is.
- Notebook / Wiki — you need a place to store all your notes like meeting minutes, ideas, etc.
- Database — you require a place to store and organize files. For many that is your computer, iCloud or Google Drive.
- Project-based — base your to-do list on projects to complete, i.e. “discovery for client X” and not areas like “work” or “personal” — use tags for these.
- Have a backlog — sometimes it’s too early to start working on something. Use backlog to store things to be acted on later.
- Plan 1/3/7–1 critical thing, 3 important things, 7 nice-to-have to-dos. Avoid having more than 10 to-dos per day.
- Use time-boxes and plan to work on to-do’s during these time boxes.
- Use different colors for different types of activities (personal, work, appointments).
- Setting up quarterly goals for myself and trying to review them weekly to plan weeks around them.
- Weekly review — that worth a separate post on its own — let me know if you are interested in that.
- Practice brain dump — this is a practice that lets you move things out of your brain to paper and distribute across tools you use (to-do, calendar, notes, database). You can google that and find brain dump practice that works for you.
