## Highlights
- There is an amusing irony to the idea that more mistakes can lead to a better life.  While the trip can be a challenge, the end is enjoyable.  We see this in many “overnight success” stories if we fail to look at the journey.  It is not the same as the end justifying the means.  However, learning from mistakes is a way to make the most of the price paid for them.  We cannot roll back time, but we can avoid repeating it.
