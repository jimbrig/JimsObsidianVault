## Highlights
- This trust game in the arena of creative knowledge work will be played between your present self and two other selves: Your past and your future self.
- When you browse your Zettelkasten, you will judge its trustworthiness by the behavior of your past self. Your trust will be high when you write your notes cleanly and transparently.
- Clean means that you write in plain language and not in the gibberish that is sometimes – or, in the case of humanities, quite often – used to impress professors and colleagues. If you allow yourself to follow such a habit you will achieve one thing very reliably: You will disguise the information from your future self. Your present self will ask your past self: “Why the duck did you write such garbage?” Using big words is a method to disguise and pretend. Even if you try to fool others with big words, at least don’t do it yourself.
- Transparent means that you make very clear what you came up, and how you came up with it. Let’s imagine you have read something interesting in some magazine and want to process it. If you cite what’s in the magazine and add a footnote for it with a link to the article, then you are not transparent. You can’t trust the so-called journalist. It is not a modern phenomenon. Now it is just more obvious that journalism is not reliable.1 By relying on something non-reliable you will fall on your face. Either you trust your past self and make major gaffes, or you begin to distrust yourself which will deteriorate your creative knowledge work.
- Technique 1: The Lindy-Filter
- The Lindy-Effect is a term I picked up from Nassim Taleb. It basically says that the longer something exists, the longer it will continue to exist if it is a non-perishable entity. The reasoning is that something that proved itself in the test of time means it proved itself for the future. This is the reason why we can have access to timeless principles. The idea is very prevalent in books like Principles by Ray Dalio and 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Covey (Amazon affiliate links). Often these books are based on the personal lessons a very successful person has experienced repeatedly over his or her lifetime.
- That leads to another aspect of the Lindy-Filter, in a way I came up with on my own: The Consilience of Knowledge. This is a term I learned from Edward O. Wilson, but I learned the principles beforehand from authors like Bruno Latour and the position of coherentism. The principle is very easy to understand: The more perspectives come together when proving something and/or failing to falsify it, the better. Imagine you read something about self-confidence in an obscure self-help book but then find similar statements in Buddhist texts. You dig a bit deeper and find the same statements in psychoanalyst and behaviorist books. And even more: You read something about confidence and “trust” in games theory that further supports the initial claim. Now you’ve got more than just multiple claims of the same sort. They are from very different methods and refer to different time spans. Buddhist texts are very old and quite time-tested. Some other texts are not that old but are more rigid – hopefully, based on scientific rigor.
- You can see that accumulating evidence from different perspectives can add trust in a non-linear way
- Technique 2: The ZKM Evidence Scale™ (ZES)
