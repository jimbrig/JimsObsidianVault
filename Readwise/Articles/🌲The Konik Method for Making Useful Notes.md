## Highlights
- Motivations: Start with the WHY
- Problem Solving
- Sometimes the problem is "I need to decide on an email app" or "I want to build my dream house" or "how can I keep track of all the important things that happen with my kid?" â€“ sometimes it's "I keep getting SEO hits for the Dark Smith of Drontheim even though it's only a casual mention from a six year old article about modern folklore like road gators, I should learn more about the dark smith so I can hit that SEO niche better."
- Pursuing Serendipity
- Most of what I learn comes to me not so much "by accident" or "unintentionally" as reactively. People usually use 'active vs passive' in a notetaking context as a proxy for how thoroughly you are engaging with a source - whether you're thinking independent thoughts or just absorbing the information by rote. But since I pretty much never do the latter (even when teachers wished I would!) I've chosen to repurpose the dichotomy. For me, "reactive" note making happens when I am basically killing time.
- With Videos
- I almost never do "dedicated notetaking" when I'm watching videos. I haven't taken anything that feels like college lecture notes in years; I don't particularly enjoy audiovisual content for its own sake, so I usually take a "get in and get out" approach where I'm looking for one specific thing that has to be conveyed visually to be maximally effective, like how to effectively skin and butcher a crocodile... which was remarkably useful when I was writing a scene about a character who was unexpectedly stuck dealing with a wyvern corpse in the middle of a desert.Generally, I either need to "bookmark" the video where I can find it again when I need it (I linked to the video above in a hidden comment on the scene I wrote), or take one or two quick notes about one or two obscure tidbits I picked up.
- With People
- With Written Content
- Methods: How To Record Information In Useful Ways
- Making Notes Directly
- First, a caveat. Some people like to integrate their highlighting and annotating tools into their notetaking app. Obsidian has the annotator plugin, Logseq has a direct bridge to Zotero, and I'm sure other tools use other methods to facilitate this. As I've explained on Twitter in the past, I avoid annotating directly from my note-taking app. I strongly prefer to use a dedicated reference manager, a dedicated PDF reader and to store PDFs in a dedicated folder. Although Obsidian now supports multiple windows â€“ which allows me to optimally use multiple screens â€“ it doesn't feel as robust and future-proof as using a purpose-built app.
- Typically, when I'm taking notes directly, I've got my browser open on my left-hand screen and my notes open on the right-hand screen. Maybe I'm looking for the answer to a question, maybe I'm just stumbling across something cool on Twitter, but if I stumble across a useful piece of information through one of my sources above, there are basically three things I can do with it: Record it in a pre-existing note,Create a new note, or send it to Readwise to be dealt with indirectly.
- Logs and indexes, which are basically lists of things like "handy LaTeX guides," Â "scripts I need to access my server," "useful accessibility tools," "travel tips for Harper's Ferry" "books I'd like to read someday" and concept notes like "the Bronze Age" and "Chinese infrastructure" â€“ they're basically places I shove information on a given topic in a moderately haphazard way, on the assumption that when I'm looking for information on Chinese infrastructure or getting ready to visit Harper's Ferry, the information I thought worth saving will be easy to find.
