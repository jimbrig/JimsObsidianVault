## Highlights
- At this juncture, we are ready to open Excel and to begin thinking about structuring. At the highest possible level, every model can/should be divided into three sections: (a) [inputs/drivers](http://www.streetofwalls.com/finance-training-courses/investment-banking-technical-training/three-statement-financial-modeling/), (b) [calculations](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/modeling/what-is-financial-modeling/) (projected financial statements), and (c) [outputs](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/modeling/what-is-financial-modeling/). The better one is at segregating these sections, the easier it will be to audit and amend the model while minimizing errors and optimizing on time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsppw0ezht2be2nztmv0fwy))
- **Cover Page (Tab):** Project code name, a description of the model’s intent, the author’s contact information, and any applicable disclaimers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsppzx1sfcx0f0kbfz52qqr))
- **Drivers Tab:** Inputs and assumptions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspq1btd15qmznv64g9wtx6))
- **Model Tab:** Calculations (i.e., the three financial statement projections and calculations). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspq21z5f6tq6gk4184x9e7))
- **Outputs Tab:** A clean, neat summary of the most important highlights of the model. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspq2s9642fmczmrh3rr47d))
- **Sensitivities Tab:** The range of scenarios, [sensitivities](https://www.wallstreetprep.com/knowledge/financial-modeling-techniques-sensitivity-what-if-analysis-2/), and data outcomes that management will rely on as they transition into their decision-making process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspq4k3eavyckr65mws18kb))
- The **cover page** is the first point of contact with your work. While it is the simplest to build, when done well, it leaves a great first impression and clearly explain what is to come. A simple, instructional cover page is generally the best approach and typically includes the following sections: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspq6fbjs7g5apvbk4p7t17))
- **Name of the Model:** Self-explanatory. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspq7tjv0m4750g0f2hmwbm))
- **Purpose of the Model:** A paragraph describing its intended use(s) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspq8as878jmgd4fmbgy9h8))
- **Model Index:** A brief table detailing each tab’s description and purpose. This section can be especially helpful to non-finance operators, helping them “digest” the model’s structure and flow by highlighting which tabs they need to use for inputs, which outputs to focus on during decision-making, and which complex calculation tabs they should leave untouched. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspq8tvh7r50djkc72p31f4))
- **Model Version History:** Investing a few seconds in typing, by date, the key changes made to the model as you go along always saves time down the road, especially if you need to retrace and reverse/modify changes. This is especially true for complex models and models that you may use as templates in future periods. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspqa9bbrjjgayqknf4fc56))
- **Author’s Contact Information:** Self-explanatory ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspqaz4d829nzbgmd8cnqgd))
- **Applicable Legal Disclaimers** (if any, as provided by your Legal Counsel)**:** Self-explanatory ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspqceve4j82gewbn5s824p))
- Immediately following the model’s cover page, must come the [**drivers (inputs) tab**](http://www.streetofwalls.com/finance-training-courses/investment-banking-technical-training/three-statement-financial-modeling/). You must ensure that this tab is clear, concise, and easy to understand, as this is the tab that non-finance operators will likely manipulate most often. I usually recommend implementing two input sections within the inputs tab, one for *static* inputs and the other for *dynamic*. By *static inputs* I mean inputs that don’t change over time, such as the hypothetical “size of a power plant” or “a company’s starting debt balance”; and by *dynamic inputs*, I mean inputs that are variable over time (e.g., month-to-month, or year-to-year) such as “inflation” assumptions, “cost of debt,” or “revenue growth” assumptions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspqeeda1r2smycf5kgen0r))
- Within both of the above *static* vs. *dynamic* input sections, I recommend that you also clearly separate your data into two kinds: (1) [hard-coded](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-hard-coding-in-excel) figures that don’t change irrespective of assumptions scenario, and (b) [sensitizing parameters](https://www.wallstreetprep.com/knowledge/financial-modeling-techniques-sensitivity-what-if-analysis-2/) that will drive different assumption scenarios and ultimately your sensitivity tables. Note, however, that you never fully know which parameters are going to constitute sensitivity parameters and which you will not until the final stages of the project. For more on sensitivity modeling, please refer to the following [article](https://www.wallstreetprep.com/knowledge/financial-modeling-techniques-sensitivity-what-if-analysis-2/). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspqjxetv62djgt1a8rknt1))
- **Financial Output Tab:** This is an abridged summary of the financials detailed in the model tab. They are usually presented on an annual basis (even though the model may be quarterly). This output should be between 50 and 150 rows and should present all the key line-items from the calculation tabs. Please be sure to present enough detail so as to ensure users are not toggling between this tab and various Calculations tabs. Please also note that, as a best practice, no output tabs should re-perform any calculation and this information should only include direct links in. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspr57nfenmjkwqrk5q4sm2))
- **Executive Summary Tab:** This tab is pretty standard and usually presents a mix of graphs, charts and tables, illustrating, as simply and as easily digestible as possible, the various trends, analyses and key summary statistics that executives and board members require to navigate their key decisions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspr2m6m9pj57xsg048zd2q))
- **Specific Output Tab:** This tab contains specific outputs, usually dictated by the template of the investment memo, the investment committee presentation, or requests by executives and board members as required to reach their decision points. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspr6q205tpypefw0340jxn))
- At this juncture, the construction phase of the model is officially complete. We may turn our attention to some of the expert-level modeling best practices I referred to at the onset of the article. Let’s begin with formatting. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspr9d36gzds4ce5fya0k7v))
- First, it is important to note that each firm/group might have its own preferences or internal practices. As such, while building, it is important to first check in with—and adhere to—whatever format your respective firm prescribes. In the absence of firm-specific practices, however, the content below details Wall Street’s universal language for formatting a model. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsprc9q0jpcfxq6nzxq9cxd))
- The first and lowest-hanging formatting method for financial modeling is to use consistent and identifiable color schemes to denote different types of cells and data. As follows: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsprfzx44s2gmh601jqhvpg))
- Blue = Inputs, or any hard-coded data, such as historical values, assumptions, and drivers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsprf0mcydabzag1repnzg3))
- Black = Formulas, calculations, or references deriving from the same sheet. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsprgxseg60s866whxh8kw5))
- Green = Formulas, calculations and references to other sheets (note though that some models skip this step altogether and use black for these cells). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsprhcw8e8dq51e197v8be4))
- Purple = Links, inputs, formulas, references, or calculations to other Excel files (again, note that some models skip this step altogether and use black for these cells also). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsprj22fq8h66qjqtccn1f1))
- Red = Error to be fixed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsprkme5vh2khzhr8r9zat9))
- Please note that there is no in-built automation functionality to color code your Excel spreadsheets according to the universal color coding standards above. Instead, you may design your own [macro(s)](https://powerspreadsheets.com/excel-macro-tutorial-for-beginners/) to achieve these outcomes, and subsequently create [shortcut combinations](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/keyboard-shortcuts-in-excel-for-windows-1798d9d5-842a-42b8-9c99-9b7213f0040f) to automatically color-code your work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsprnqgebswmdc13apvy276))
- Hit Alt + W + M + R, concurrently, to name and begin recording your macro. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspskza7kttrkv0cr13qqhg))
- Hit F5 (“Jump to Cell”) and then Alt + S, concurrently, to arrive at the “Go to Special” menu. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspspzjay1dazfcye3nwjk2))
- Hit “O” to select Constants and “X” to uncheck text. 
  ![](https://uploads.toptal.io/blog/image/125944/toptal-blog-image-1524117438614-ff32202023f34162bc838cfe05d1f35c.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspstj8r1hs8bgzzaxd3bww))
- Now hit Alt + H + FC (or Ctrl + 1), concurrently, and select your blue font color for these constants. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspsyhr27ehzcjmj9dtyf6z))
- Hit Esc. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspt599aka9tdwph26brj74))
- Now do the same thing, starting with F5, but select Formulas (F) instead of constants and press “X” to uncheck text. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspt627rdd83v8v692f5yzw))
- Now hit Alt + H + FC (or Ctrl + 1) and select a Black font color for these constants. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspt7bw3kbjsgzmcp2ptphc))
- Stop recording the macro with Alt + W + M + R or Alt + T + M + R. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspt7zp573hve4sx3154e51))
- Links to Other Workbooks ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsptayz8m24g32hmmh8ae1f))
- Finding links to other workbooks and worksheets is tricky, and you will most likely have to use [VBA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1vdt0FddsE) to get this working correctly. Here’s the basic idea: search for the presence of the symbol “!” in each cell that contains a formula across your workbook, and then change the font color to green. You will need to modify this in the [VBA Editor](https://powerspreadsheets.com/excel-visual-basic-editor/) and make it a [`for each` loop](https://www.excelcampus.com/vba/for-each-next-loop/) through all instances of “!” you find, and then change the font color for each of these. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsptdf52sw40ee8cj1agnf9))
- Please be aware that this shortcut still won’t work 100% of the time because some formulas will reference cells in other worksheets without directly linking to them. Fortunately, green cells are rarer than black or blue cells, so the method above works fairly well in most models (and you can organically format the rest of your links to other worksheets manually as they come up or as you come across them). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsptsmj7jfrzcgcb0rxd76n))
- Best Practices for Auditing a Model ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsptvfmz7a3btv0dkhgxzhh))
- When modeling, I encourage you to always bear this single question at the back of your mind: “Am I making this model easily auditable?” because for every task executed, formula created, and link built, there will always be a faster, “dirtier” (in industry parlance) way to do the job. Such hacks and tricks, however clever they may seem at the time, and especially after time intervals, will invariably be forgotten and will lead to hard-to-track-down errors. Keeping a third-person reviewer in mind will guide you through your process and help you come to the right decision at key junctures. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsptyd6swx2r7b2dnetttkx))
- 1. One Row, One Formula ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspv314z5mp2tjrhcdxkmk5))
- You should have only one formula per row, meaning that whatever formula is used in the first cell of any given row should be the same formula uniformly applied across the entire row. Users should understand the structure of your model by looking at the first cell of each row as they proceed vertically down your model. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspv3t6nxw67zns1msb7zn7))
- While this is simple in principle, it is violated often enough to highlight further. A common instance often takes place when spreadsheets are split between a “historical financials” group of columns and “outer-year forecasts” (see image above entitled, “Example of Well-formatted (Color-coded) Financials Summary,” as a reference). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspv67sr0x7naprskwmn30e))
- One easy way to address these instances, is the use of [flags](http://www.financial-modelling.net/tutorials/excel/working-with-flags) (e.g., 1/0, `TRUE`/`FALSE`) positioned at the top of the spreadsheet, then referenced using [`IF` statements](https://www.exceltrick.com/formulas_macros/excel-if-statement/) through the body of one’s model. A simple illustration of this at work is as follows: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspv7asjtdhhx3dqm6vh7qd))
- 2. No Hard-coded Numbers Embedded Within Formulas ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspvhzgam17nacfvvhxnz0h))
- Never use hard-coded numbers embedded in formulas because they are very difficult to spot if the user is less familiar with the model. Instead, clearly highlight and separate the inputs/hard-codes from the formulas; better yet, gather all the inputs/hard-codes (as appropriate) and aggregate them in the same tab. Subsequently have your formulas pull/reference them as appropriate from the required cell and from the appropriate tab. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspvjm07wgx7e0ks7dsencm))
- 3. Simple Is Always Better ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspvn8dv8t0h4v5mhznshwp))
- It is always better to avoid complicated formulas. Instead, break up your formula into easily digestible steps. Instead of one seemingly neat row, this approach will often create many more rows, resulting in a larger spreadsheet; but one that will be much easier to follow and audit by a third party. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspvp1fp5v4kepee5cbmvzc))
- 4. Adhere Consistently to Your Sign Convention ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspvpzndsggam2jva34nbvb))
- You should decide at time-zero what your sign convention/key will be. By way of illustration, ask yourself in the design stage of your model, “Will costs, expenses, deductions, depreciation, CapEx, etc. be presented as negative or positive numbers?” My personal preference is to always present costs as negative numbers for two reasons: (a) The totals will always be straight sums and you will minimize user error, and (b) it will be easier to spot mistakes using just the signs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspvr8ybzb4evywnzqbnm28))
- 5. Avoid Naming Your Cells, Instead Rely on Excel’s Grid Logic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspvt1hx37ageffzwfq3mw0))
- Where possible I strongly recommend avoiding naming your cells as it becomes difficult to locate the source input for said named cell (e.g., “Inflation”) down the road. Instead, I recommend that you rely on the grid convention of Excel within your formulas (e.g., simply linking to cell C4 or location, `[Tab Name]l'!G21`, if the reference is in a different tab or workbook). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspw3ajeh276496qkgsbc2w))
- 6. Never Have the Same Input in Multiple Locations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspw62nbfxbmhg3r9her522))
- Organize your inputs simply and transparently. It is my recommendation that you consolidate all inputs in a few driver tabs and reference them from their singular points of origin throughout the spreadsheet. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspw6p0kbynbdmqz6920wqp))
- 7. Avoid Linking Files ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspw8at329580apvf8qc7fy))
- Avoid linking to other files. It is better to input the relevant data you require from a different file as hard-coded inputs, which you then manually update as required. Cross-linking has been known to crash larger Excel models or update inconsistently, thereby creating hard-to-track errors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspw8vqsscvn0mcpdwv7w28))
- 8. Don’t Hide Sheets or Rows ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspwahv3vwrabg1yydnnf4a))
- Within longer spreadsheet, “group” rows/columns rather than “hide” them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspwb34sfhadk12fsdxr5mx))
- 9. Fewer, Bigger Tabs Are Better Than Multiple Smaller Tabs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspwbkp0dh5n53y4v2dfxm8))
- This practice is based 100% on experience. It is easier to follow and audit a continuous array for data across one large, contiguous spreadsheet, than across multiple tabs or, worse, multiple spreadsheets that are cross-linked. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspwdjsx4n7xg74pzeyw2mb))
- 10. Create Checks Throughout Your Model via “Aggregated Error Checks” Located in One Tab ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspwf7pkzxs67d4862f3dc1))
- [Checks](http://www.financial-modelling.net/tutorials/excel/excel-using-checks) are the easiest way to quickly review the integrity of a model. “Checks” encompass everything from ensuring that totals that should tie actually do to ensuring that one’s balance sheet actually balances. I usually build a few checks at the top or bottom of each spreadsheet then consolidate them in a separate “Check Tab.” This ensures that it is easy to find an error in the model and then trace where that error originated. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspwhvcmx6x69qxccgndhyp))
- This section covers a couple of very effective Excel best practices for our more advanced users. These might require a bit of adjusting, but should save several hours of work later and be relatively simple to implement. They are as follows, in short, succinct, to-the-point bullets: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspwv1wektxhd28tjh374kr))
- Use as many keyboard shortcuts as possible. There are several files in the internet on Excel Keyboard shortcuts that fit different needs. I’ll reference a couple here: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspwxa0sgyx1fkm1wh38n2t))
- Use F5 (“go to special”) to quickly locate all hard-coded numbers or formulas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspwy9j49ksgexwdk321g5g))
- Use [`XNPV`](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/excel/study/xnpv-function-in-excel/) and [`XIRR`](https://www.techonthenet.com/excel/formulas/xirr.php) to allow for the application of *custom__ dates* to cash flows, en route to a returns analysis; this, as opposed to Excel’s [`NPV`](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/valuation/npv-formula/) and [`IRR`](http://www.investinganswers.com/education/time-value-money/calculating-internal-rate-return-using-excel-or-financial-calculator-2129) functions, which implicitly assume equidistant time intervals for the calculation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspx08dvnqsha78z5yp56q7))
- Use the [`INDEX MATCH`](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/excel/study/index-match-formula-excel/) function over the [`VLOOKUP`](https://www.techonthenet.com/excel/formulas/vlookup.php) function for looking up information across large spreadsheets. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspx25vbr9m19p8ymab887t))
- Get in the habit of including [`IFERROR`](https://exceljet.net/excel-functions/excel-iferror-function) in the syntax of your formulas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspx2ymx0rjnqkr811ys6b7))
- [Remove gridlines](https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/2014/04/23/hide-show-gridlines-excel/) when presenting or sharing the financial model; it makes for a cleaner, more polished output document. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grspx3vr6dx2ngd4cabc5gzg))
