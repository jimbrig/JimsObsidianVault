> *Description of note contents.*

## Minimum Specifications

- CPU: *Core i5* or *Ryzen 5*
- Screen: *1920x1080 IPS*
- RAM: *8GB*
- Storage: Must be *SSD* and >= 512GB
- Graphics: Must Support Discrete (not Integrated) Graphics Processor
	- NVIDIA RTX 4050 or 4070
	- AMD Radeon RX 7000
- Battery Life: 9+ Hours
- Screen: 12.5-14 inches

## Optimal Specifications

- CPU: *Intel 13th Gen Raptor Lake Processor*
	- AMD Alternative: *AMD Ryzen 7000*

## Considerations


- Mobility: Size, Screen Estate, Battery, Touchscreen
	- Suggestions: 
		- *Avoid touchscreens as they do not provide enough benefits to justify extra cost.*
		- *If travel a lot, or want portable laptop, 13 or 14-inch laptop screen will do*

- [Display]():
	- Base Display is typically around `1366x768` which is mediocre at best.
	- On the other hand, `4k` display is probably overkill with added costs and battery drain
	- **Do not go under Full HD 1920 x 1080 (1080p) Display**

- Processing Power (CPU and Chipset):
	- Don't skimp here
	- Some important considerations are cache size, number of physical cores, frequency, and thermal design power.
	- Lowest: AMD Ryzen 5000 Series or Intel 8th Gen i7 Processor
	- Intel i7 or Ryzen 7 processor or higher with frequency >= 3GHz
	- Intel Core i7-11800H/Core i9-11900H
	- Best of class: Intel i13 or Ryzen 7000 Zen 4
	- Note that more processing typically reduces battery life
	- Cores:
		- At least 6 physical cores
	- Intel vs. AMD
		- Intel:
			- Core i3, i5, i7, i9
		- AMD:
			- 
	
- Ports:
	- >= 2 USB-C
	- >= 2 USB-A
	- SD Card Reader
	- Charge via USB-C Preferrable
	- Thunderbold 4 Ports (extension of USB-C Version 3/4)
	- 
- 
- Memory (RAM):
	- Minimum 8GB
	- Ideally want 16GB with option to upgrade if necessary
	- Avoid *soldered* RAM
	- Best of Class: 32GB RAM with DDR4 (Double Date Rate), not DDR3
	- 16GB, 32GB, 64GB
	
- Storage (SSD, HDD, RAID, ReFS):
	- SSD is a must
	- Minimum 512GB
	- Optionally can have OS on 256GB SSD and use HDD for data
	- 512GB, 1TB, 2TB
	- PCIe x4 (NVME) Units are triple the spped of traditional SATA drives
	- eMMC memory SSDs are not any better than HDDs
	- 

- Graphics:
	- Dedicated vs Integrated:
		- Integrated Graphics:
			- Graphics Card is bundled into the motherboard with the processor 
		- Dedicated (Discrete) Graphics:
			- Separate GPU
			- Intel paired with NVIDIA/AMD GPU
			- For NVIDIA, GeForce. For AMD, Radeon
	- Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080
	- Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050/3050 Ti
			
		- A dedicated (also known as discrete) graphics card isnâ€™t very important for coding purposes. Save money by going with an integrated graphics card. Invest the money you save in an SSD or a better processor which will provide more value for the money.

- 
- [CPU and Processor](): Look for mid-to-high level chipsets. Aviod default entry-level chips like Intel Core i3 or AMD Ryzen 3.
- [RAM](): 
- [Storage](): Ensure Solid State Drive (SSD), not HDD. Size-wise looking for SSD ~512GB or more. Combo SSD/HDD
- 

### Prioritize Processor, Graphics Card, and RAM
