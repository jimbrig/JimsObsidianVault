# Foreign Key Constraints in Relational Databases

## Foreign Key Constraints

A foreign key (FK) is a column or combination of columns that is used to establish and enforce a link between the data in two tables to control the data that can be stored in the foreign key table. In a foreign key reference, a link is created between two tables when the column or columns that hold the primary key value for one table are referenced by the column or columns in another table. This column becomes a foreign key in the second table.

For example, the `Sales.SalesOrderHeader` table has a foreign key link to the `Sales.SalesPerson` table because there is a logical relationship between sales orders and salespeople. The `SalesPersonID` column in the `SalesOrderHeader` table matches the primary key column of the `SalesPerson` table. The `SalesPersonID` column in the `SalesOrderHeader` table is the foreign key to the `SalesPerson` table. By creating this foreign key relationship, a value for `SalesPersonID` cannot be inserted into the `SalesOrderHeader` table if it does not already exist in the `SalesPerson` table.

A table can reference a maximum of 253 other tables and columns as foreign keys (outgoing references). SQL Server 2016 (13.x) increases the limit for the number of other tables and columns that can reference columns in a single table (incoming references), from 253 to 10,000. (Requires at least 130 compatibility level.) The increase has the following restrictions:

-   Greater than 253 foreign key references are only supported for DELETE DML operations. UPDATE and MERGE operations are not supported.
    
-   A table with a foreign key reference to itself is still limited to 253 foreign key references.
    
-   Greater than 253 foreign key references are not currently available for columnstore indexes, memory-optimized tables, Stretch Database, or partitioned foreign key tables.
    

## Indexes on Foreign Key Constraints

Unlike primary key constraints, creating a foreign key constraint does not automatically create a corresponding index. However, manually creating an index on a foreign key is often useful for the following reasons:

-   Foreign key columns are frequently used in join criteria when the data from related tables is combined in queries by matching the column or columns in the foreign key constraint of one table with the primary or unique key column or columns in the other table. An index enables the Database Engine to quickly find related data in the foreign key table. However, creating this index is not required. Data from two related tables can be combined even if no primary key or foreign key constraints are defined between the tables, but a foreign key relationship between two tables indicates that the two tables have been optimized to be combined in a query that uses the keys as its criteria.
    
-   Changes to primary key constraints are checked with foreign key constraints in related tables.
    

## Referential Integrity

Although the main purpose of a foreign key constraint is to control the data that can be stored in the foreign key table, it also controls changes to data in the primary key table. For example, if the row for a salesperson is deleted from the `Sales.SalesPerson` table, and the salesperson's ID is used for sales orders in the `Sales.SalesOrderHeader` table, the relational integrity between the two tables is broken; the deleted salesperson's sales orders are orphaned in the `SalesOrderHeader` table without a link to the data in the `SalesPerson` table.

A foreign key constraint prevents this situation. The constraint enforces referential integrity by guaranteeing that changes cannot be made to data in the primary key table if those changes invalidate the link to data in the foreign key table. If an attempt is made to delete the row in a primary key table or to change a primary key value, the action will fail when the deleted or changed primary key value corresponds to a value in the foreign key constraint of another table. To successfully change or delete a row in a foreign key constraint, you must first either delete the foreign key data in the foreign key table or change the foreign key data in the foreign key table, which links the foreign key to different primary key data.

### Cascading Referential Integrity

By using cascading referential integrity constraints, you can define the actions that the Database Engine takes when a user tries to delete or update a key to which existing foreign keys point. The following cascading actions can be defined.

`NO ACTION`  
The Database Engine raises an error and the delete or update action on the row in the parent table is rolled back.

`CASCADE`
Corresponding rows are updated or deleted in the referencing table when that row is updated or deleted in the parent table. `CASCADE` cannot be specified if a **timestamp** column is part of either the foreign key or the referenced key. `ON DELETE CASCADE` cannot be specified for a table that has an `INSTEAD OF DELETE` trigger. `ON UPDATE CASCADE` cannot be specified for tables that have `INSTEAD OF UPDATE` triggers.

`SET NULL`
All the values that make up the foreign key are set to NULL when the corresponding row in the parent table is updated or deleted. For this constraint to execute, the foreign key columns must be nullable. Cannot be specified for tables that have `INSTEAD OF UPDATE` triggers.

`SET DEFAULT`
All the values that make up the foreign key are set to their default values if the corresponding row in the parent table is updated or deleted. For this constraint to execute, all foreign key columns must have default definitions. If a column is nullable, and there is no explicit default value set, `NULL` becomes the implicit default value of the column. Cannot be specified for tables that have `INSTEAD OF UPDATE` triggers.

`CASCADE`, `SET NULL`, `SET DEFAULT` and `NO ACTION` can be combined on tables that have referential relationships with each other. If the Database Engine encounters `NO ACTION`, it stops and rolls back related `CASCADE`, `SET NULL` and `SET DEFAULT` actions. When a `DELETE` statement causes a combination of `CASCADE`, `SET NULL`, `SET DEFAULT` and `NO ACTION` actions, all the `CASCADE`, `SET NULL` and `SET DEFAULT` actions are applied before the Database Engine checks for any `NO ACTION`.

### Triggers and Cascading Referential Actions

Cascading referential actions fire the `AFTER UPDATE` or `AFTER DELETE` triggers in the following manner:

-   All the cascading referential actions directly caused by the original `DELETE` or `UPDATE` are performed first.
    
-   If there are any `AFTER` triggers defined on the affected tables, these triggers fire after all cascading actions are performed. These triggers fire in opposite order of the cascading action. If there are multiple triggers on a single table, they fire in random order, unless there is a dedicated first or last trigger for the table. This order is as specified by using [sp_settriggerorder](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-settriggerorder-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15).
    
-   If multiple cascading chains originate from the table that was the direct target of an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` action, the order in which these chains fire their respective triggers is unspecified. However, one chain always fires all its triggers before another chain starts firing.
    
-   An `AFTER` trigger on the table that is the direct target of an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` action fires regardless of whether any rows are affected. There are no other tables affected by cascading in this case.
    
-   If any one of the previous triggers performs `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operations on other tables, these actions can start secondary cascading chains. These secondary chains are processed for each `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operation at a time after all triggers on all primary chains fire. This process may be recursively repeated for subsequent `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operations.
    
-   Performing `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DELETE`, or other [[Data Definition Language]] (DDL) operations inside the triggers may cause DDL triggers to fire. This may subsequently perform `DELETE` or `UPDATE` operations that start additional cascading chains and triggers.
    
-   If an error is generated inside any particular cascading referential action chain, an error is raised, no `AFTER` triggers are fired in that chain, and the `DELETE` or `UPDATE` operation that created the chain is rolled back.
    
-   A table that has an `INSTEAD OF` trigger cannot also have a `REFERENCES` clause that specifies a cascading action. However, an `AFTER` trigger on a table targeted by a cascading action can execute an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement on another table or view that fires an `INSTEAD OF` trigger defined on that object.
