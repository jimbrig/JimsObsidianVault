# Project Documentation Naming Conventions and Repository Guidelines

*Source: [[Project Documentation Naming Conventions and Repository Guidelines.pdf]]*

## Purpose

The purpose of the Project Documentation Naming Conventions and Repository Guideline is to establish project documentation naming standards and structure for project documentation repositories. This guideline is intended to help the project manager organize the project notebook by providing a simple set of rules for creating and storing project documentation, and illustrates the application of these rules to a sample project.

## Approach

Two important components of any Project Management Repository (PMR) are a standard project repository structure and standard project naming conventions. Other important components of a PMR include the physical repository (file store or database), as well as, the processes related to creating, managing, and archiving the project management documentation.

A project documentation repository supported by an established project repository structure (taxonomy) provides an area for creating, managing, and archiving project management data and documents for a specific project. It enables the project team to work together in an efficient manner, and supports re-use of data and documents in executing project management practices on future projects.

Project naming conventions include a standard format for the name and unique identification of each project, and standard identification for each project deliverable. The naming conventions also include version control attributes for both project management and software development (engineering) documentation.

Project naming conventions and a project repository structure provide a number of benefits that are important for improving project management practices. Specifically, they enhance:

- Project team communication

- Project management efficiency

- Project documentation management

- Configuration Management of project deliverables

- Project orientation for new team members

## Project Classes

Projects are classified as Class A, Class B, or Class C using the Project Classification Criteria template. The project classification criteria are:

Â· Impact on Citizens, Operations, and Agencies

Â· Visibility

Â· Impact of Not Completing the Project

Â· Maturity of Technology

Â· Agency Project Management Capability

A complete explanation of project classification can be found in the PM Guide, PM Handbook, SD Handbook, or Project Classification Criteria template.
