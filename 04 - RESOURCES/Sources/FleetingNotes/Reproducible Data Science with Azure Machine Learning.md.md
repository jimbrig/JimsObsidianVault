## Overview

Being able to explain your own code a few months after you wrote it is hard. Imagine having to explain the decisions of some AI algorithm a few years after it run! However, it is relatively easy to set up your development workflow to make that possible, as long as you realize that the way we build ML and AI is fundamentally different from traditional software engineering. 

In a nutshell, it is all about: [[Reproducible Research]], [[Development]] and [[Deployment]]. It is made possible by a clever use of [[modern notebook environments]], including [[Azure ML Compute Instances]], as opposed to the more traditional IDEs, like [[Visual Studio Code]]. 

## Reproducible Workflow

1. Create a project to hold source, in-memory data, and history
2. Version Control with [[03 - AREAS/Tools/Tools - Version Control/Git]]
3. Select a snapshot of package sources
4. Work in a [[Developer Notebooks|developer notebook]]
5. Save and Export/Share your Findings
6. Push to Production
