# Loss Data Analytics

**Structure**. A working model is the "[Online Statistics Education](http://onlinestatbook.com/)" project put together by Rice University and others. This site provides a free online text that provides an introduction to probability and statistics. With NSF funding, it was written by over 20 authors. Online versions, both web and IBook formats, provide a full suite of interactive learning experiences. See the [Structure and Scope](https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/loss-data-analytics/project-files/structure-and-scope) sub-page for more thoughts.  

**Scope**. One vision is sort of an "Actuar-pedia" for _Loss Data Analytics_. Instead of an encyclopedia of entries, the text will be centered around the courses that we teach with specific "chapters" covering different learning objects. However, the flexibility of the web means that we do not have the limitations on scope that one traditionally finds in texts. The goal is to put together a resource that students from many systems, North American, European, Commonwealth, and others, would find of interest.

### Audience I - What do Students Want?

*   Identify Prerequisite Knowledge - what do I need to know to read this text efficiently?
		*   The current proposal is that prerequisites assume knowledge of one year of calculus, one-half year of probability and a smattering of mathematical statistics. This is a wide audience, encompassing virtually everyone who self-identifies as an "actuary"
*   Identify Learning Objectives - what will I learn with this text that will help me succeed in more advanced courses/text?
*   Link to professional association requirements - how will this text help me meet the learning objectives of professional associations?
*   Link to Industry Applications - how will this text help me in with tasks that I will regularly face in practice?
		*   Ready access to data
*   Entertaining
*   Active Learning
*   Computer Examples/Demonstrations/Exercises
*   Glossary
*   Quizzes
*   Available Worldwide to an International Audience
		*   Available in multiple Languages
*   Print as well as Web Version

### Audience II - What do Instructors Want?
*   An authoritative textbook
*   Overheads that summarize key chapter points to be used in class presentations
*   Exercises to reinforce fundamental concepts
*   Data/empirical demonstrations to demonstrate concepts and applications  

### Role of Providers/Suppliers
*   Finalize an administrative structure for things such as:
*   Where to host
*   Issues of copyright/ownership/permissions of intellectual content
*   A set of incentives for providers. We intend to recognize editors and authors for their work on the book web site. We will apply for funding to pay students for their work.
*   Will need to establish conditions for:  
*   Initial "acceptance" of a chapter
*   Revision protocols
*   Acceptance and revisions of exercises and other supporting material
*   Funding and Sponsorship. There has been some discussion of applying to the Society of Actuaries CAE grant program to have funds available in June 2018 to pay students. The IAA, through the group, AWB ("Actuaries Without Borders") may be interested in providing (non-financial) sponsorship. With funding, we could hire students to:
*   Help authors convert latex code to markdown and WordPress
*   Translate content into Spanish, ...?
*   Many other things (exercises, ....)
