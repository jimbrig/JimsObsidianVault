# What Gets Measured, Gets Managed

![](https://www.donnfelker.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/what-gets-measured-gets-managed-1024x623.jpg)

-   Why is this important?

## **Keep asking Why.**

You can follow **the â5 Whyâsâ method.**

Keep asking yourself âWhyâ, 5 times until you get to the root why which usually happens around the 5^th^ time you ask the âWhyâ question.

Let me give you an example:

If I want to improve the idea generation portion of my art projects, in other words, I want to be able to generate ideas faster so I can then decide what to paint more efficiently, then I would ask myself this â¦

-   Why does creating ideas faster matter?
-   Why does deciding what to paint sooner matter?
-   Why does focusing on canvas matter more than sketches?
-   Why do art shows matter?
-   Why does it matter to get your name out there in the public as an artist?

This is a completely made up, hypothetical example of the five whyâs, and you could go even deeper by asking âmore whyâsâ, but now you get the point.

It drives home the point of why you are doing something. It gets to the root cause, the underlying reason youâre doing what youâre doing.

The root cause doesnât have to be financial reward, fame, or anything like that. It can simply be a personal goal. The goal is to simply identify the root cause so you can see if itâs worth measuring.

## **One last tipâ¦**

If you want to start managing your goals with a common framework, you can use the S.M.A.R.T. goal framework.

A [[S.M.A.R.T. Goals.md]] is â¦

-   **S**pecific (canât be general, has to
-   **M**easurable (has to be a way to measure it)
-   **A**chievable (something you can actually do in the given time frame)
-   **R**elevant (to your mission in life/big goals)
-   **T**ime-bound (has to have a period when it ends)

If a goal fits within the S.M.A.R.T. framework and you manage it (track it in regard to your time but achievable goal) there is a good chance youâll get it done.

## **The Final Word**

The next time you find yourself at a crossroads or wondering how or why something is or is not happening â ask yourself if there is something you can measure.

If so, start measuring it.

It will be a pain at first, but after a while, it becomes a habit and the data you get out of it will help you make more informed decisions so that you can improve you life in any number of ways.

## **If you can measure it, youâll manage it.**
