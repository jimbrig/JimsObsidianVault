# Ludicrously Complex Projects

## Clear Ownership

Split out the project into separate buckets of work duties with leaders for each bucket:

- Administrative
- Technical
- Strategy and Planning

## Track Progress

Communicate and track project's progression through sharing a project timeline and use it as a *single source of truth*. Keep it updated to reflect reality.

## Make Effective Decisions

- Brainstorm and be thoughtful by taking into account any and all long and short term implications.
- Optimize for efficiency
- Organize and Communicate

## Manage Dependencies

Anticipate bottlenecks â Make a table or diagram that maps out who your team relies on, and who relies on your team.

Keep tabs on it â Assign one owner from each side who looks after each dependency. Make sure the dependency owners understand and communicate the impact of changes to all upstream and downstream teams.
