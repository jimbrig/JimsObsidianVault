> An aspirational diet will have you dreaming of success; but it's the attachment of expectations and tangible goals that feeds the desire, persistence, and fortitude required to make the win.

## âï¸ Todo:

- [ ] Powwater: Implement new delivery fee pricing table from Ellie (see emails): [Link to GitHub Issue](https://github.com/powwater/adminportal/issues/34)
	- [x] Adminportal: Add new data_prep R script, SQL creation file, and CSV lookup for the pricing table
	- [ ] Add a new field to orders table showing the delivery fee tier associated with that order
	- [ ] Add a new field to orders table for order type fees (i.e. Refill orders are X amount more than New orders)
	- [ ] Create new tab in Adminportal that displays delivery fee tiers in a table:
		- Columns: 
   			- Tier (i.e. interval in Kilometers)
   			- New (Base) Fee
   			- Refill Fee (should be a surcharge - use `shinyFeedback`)
   			- Swap Fee (should be a discount - use `shinyFeedback`)
   		- Rows:
			- Need to discuss this further with client - do we need alternative tables between vendors? If so should add `vendor_uid` to table.
-    Add buttons to make table and data editable and allow addition of new tiers/removal of old tiers
-    Display historical order route distance and time information as reference for pricing the tiers (see vendor's app)
