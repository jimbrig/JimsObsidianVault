# Designing Cloud Implementation

## Setup

- Setup Version Control
- Setup Project Reference Materials

- Deploy a *demo* or *sandbox* environment.

- Publish/plan Milestone Dates

## Capture Business Processes and Requirements

Detailed business process analysis workshops define the business processes to be implemented in the future and identify where specific functionality of the new system will be used. At the same time, the workshops will identify gaps in functionality that may need to be resolved by a workaround, change in business practice, or modification of the system.

Typically, there would be a workshop run for each business area (for example, Accounts payable, Purchasing, Sales, and Production). Each workshop would involve key users from the customerâs business. It would be facilitated by a functional consultant and ideally supported by someone taking notes. The selection of the key users would depend on the complexity of the business processes.

The key users are responsible for presenting the results of the workshop to their own company. Depending on the size of the company, this might involve a presentation to the other teams involved on the project, or it could involve the key users going back to their own business units and presenting the details to their key people.

Remember to use Task recorder to capture out-of-the-box features, and by comparing it with gathered business requirement from your customer, identify the gaps. For more information about the Task recorder, seeÂ [Create documentation or training by using task recordings page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/user-interface/task-recorder-training-docs/).

## Perform FIT/GAP Analysis

After you have captured the business processes and requirements, a thorough analysis of each requirement is required to assess if it can be met by the standard product.

## Use Templates

Download the available templates for your data configuration. This will help start the process of completing setup required for your base set up and configuration. You will use the Asset library to download the templates.

## Sign Off Requirements and Business Processes

After you have captured the business process, requirements, fits, and gaps, review them with the customer.

When the customer signs off on the business process, requirements, fits and gaps you can mark this task as complete. Use the Business process modeler to record and manage gaps and firm the future business processes.
