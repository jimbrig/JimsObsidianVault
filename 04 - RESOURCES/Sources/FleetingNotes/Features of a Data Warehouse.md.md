# Features of a Data Warehouse

## What are some of the most important features of a Data warehouse?

Some of the basic components of a typical Data Warehouse are:  
  
1. **Central Database** : The cornerstone of your data warehouse is a database. These were conventional relational databases that could be used on-premise or in the cloud. However, in-memory databases are rapidly gaining popularity as a result of Big Data, the necessity for true, real-time speed, and a substantial fall in the cost of RAM.  
2. **Data Integration** : Various data integration technologies, such as ETL(Extract, Transform, Load), real-time data replication, bulk load processing, data transformation, data quality, etc are used to gather data from source systems and modify it so that it is ready for rapid analytical consumption.  
3. **Metadata** : It details the data sets in your data warehouse's source, usage, values, and other characteristics. Thereâs business metadata, which gives your data meaning, and technical metadata, which explains how to access data, such as where itâs stored and how itâs organized.  
4. **Data Warehouse access tools** : Users can interact with data in your data warehouse using access tools such as Query and Reporting tools, Application Development tools, Data Mining tools, OLAP tools, etc.
