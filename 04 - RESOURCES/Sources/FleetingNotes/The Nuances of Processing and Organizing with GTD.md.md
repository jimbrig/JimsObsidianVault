# The Nuances of Processing and Organizing with GTD

## Overview

The GTD method is made up of five simple practices to systematize the clutter in your brain and get things done:

1.  **Capture Everything:**Â Capture anything that crosses your mind. Nothing is too big or small! These items go directly into your inboxes.
    
2.  **Clarify:**Â Process what youâve captured intoÂ [clear and concrete action steps](https://gettingthingsdone.com/2017/02/episode-27-gtd-keys-to-clarifying/). Decide if an item is a project, next action, or reference.
    
3.  **Organize:**Â Put everything into the right place. Add dates to your calendar, delegate projects to other people, file away reference material, and sort your tasks.
    
4.  **Review:**Â Frequently look over, update, and revise your lists.
    
5.  **Engage:**Â Get to work on the important stuff.

While GTD requires an upfront investment in time and energy to set up, it pays off with consistent use. Youâll no longer worry about forgetting a deadline or missing an important task. Instead, youâll be able to respond to incoming information calmly and prioritize your time confidently.

## Actions

1. Do initial [[GTD Mindsweep]]: Performing a *full* mindsweep of all "open loops" (i.e. anything you might need to take action on in the future).
	
	- Add mindsweep items to a centralized **INBOX**
	- Consult the [[Mind_Sweep_Trigger_List.pdf|Trigger List]] to help jog your memory for commitments you may have forgotten.

2. Consolidate Inboxes

	- Make a list of all current inboxes
