# Development Best Practices - Documentation before Development

![[Pasted image 20220729153813.png]]

## Overview

This note establishes guidelines for best practices in software and web development with regard to *Documenting before Coding*.

**Documentation is Key** to become successful in software development and architecture.

## Questions

Before developing or coding anything, first answer all the following questions:

1. Where is the **Requirements Specification**?
2. Where is the **Impact Analysis Document**?
3. Where is the **Design Document**?
4. Have you documented all the **assumptions and limitations** properly?
5. Have you done a **review of all the documents**?
6. Did you get sign off on all the documents from all the **stakeholders**?

Once you have positive answers for all the above questions, you are safe and ready to proceed for the coding. Many organizations would have strict rules to be followed, but others would not have. Best practice is to complete all the required documentation and take appropriate approvals before proceeding for the software coding.

## Thoughts

So, again it is one of the best practices to have documentation as much as possible. Few important documents, which will prepare you for future are:

-   Design Approaches
-   Tips and Tricks
-   Special functions, commands and instructions
-   Lessons learnt
-   Peculiar situations
-   Debugging methods
-   Best Practices
-   Anything which can help you in future

Keeping documents electronically does not cost you. So let's start maintaining required documentation.
