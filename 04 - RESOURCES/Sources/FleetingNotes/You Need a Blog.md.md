# You Need a Blog

![](https://www.donnfelker.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/you-need-a-blog-1024x678.jpg)

Yeah, thatâs right. You need one.

Maybe you already have one. If you do, you might be reading this  
and thinking â¦

_Crap I havenât written anything in a long time._

_Why?_

Who knows. I was that way. Sometimes I still am. The last couple  
of years my blog has been a desert riddled with occasional posts.

Why?

**I got lazy.**

_I have a HUGE list of ideas I have written down in Evernote of_  
_blog posts I want to write._ Some of them are pure GOLD. Like, Why  
Recruiters are your Secret Weapon â Utilize the tool everyone  
ignores to dominate in consulting.

Sounds interesting, right? Who wouldnât want to have a constant  
flow of clients? Who wouldnât want to eliminate that fear of âOh  
no, I donât have a client and my bills are due, and my car  
payment is late, and weâre having a kid in 6 weeks. GREAT. Iâm  
screwedâ.

Iâve been there. So, yeahâ¦. You need a blog. Why? From my  
experience, Iâve found it to be very lucrative â¦

But again â¦

Why didnât I do it? Yeah, I was lazy, but also â¦.

**It wasnât a priority.** Iâm working on it though. You may have  
noticed that some of these posts that are on my email list end up  
on my blog.

Again, why am I doing that?

The better question is â why not?

Reach is reach. Any movement forward is positive movement. Iâll  
be talking about repurposing content in the near future, but  
thatâs what Iâm doing here. Iâll talk about reach and marketing  
more and more as we continue, but for now, this is about why you  
need a blog, an active blog.

Which brings me back to what people often ask me:

> Donn, how I can grow my exposure and get my name out in the  
> community so that people know me?

I usually say this:

> **You need a blog.**

They usually look at me with eyes of bewilderment and I quickly  
intercept that look with a question.

_âSeems like you donât believe me. Why?â_

Usually, the retort is that âBlogs are deadâ and â_No one reads_  
_blogs_â.

**Nonsense.**

_Do you know who reads blogs?_

Google. Bing. DuckDuckGo. etc.

**Do you know who uses those search engines? All of us.**

**Do you know who reads your articles that the search engines find?**  
**All of us.**

_Ah, makes sense right?_

How many times have you searched for something online and ran  
across an article that explained what you needed? _Probably a_  
_lot._

How many times has a friend sent you a link to something that was  
interesting? _Probably a lot._

How many times have you seen an article linked from another site  
that led to a blog? Probably a lot.

See what I mean?

Blogs are everywhere. There are thousands upon thousands of  
people making a crap-ton of money off their blogs.

Iâm not, or am I?

I donât sell anything on my blog. Sure, I have a few affiliate  
links, but that generates enough revenue for a few Chipotle  
burritos a month (no complaints there, feel free to send me all  
your burritos â Iâll eatâm).

**But yes, my blog does make money.** _In fact, itâs made me more_  
_money than I can ever have fathomed. How?_

Exposure.

Thatâs right. Exposure. The kind of exposure that I didnât  
expect.

When I started my blog I wrote about how to do things with given  
languages. From C# to databases, to Rails, to Node/etc. I still  
write about those things. However, at the time, my main focus was  
on sharing what I learned with the world via my blog.

If I created a cool way to handle errors in a resilient way, Iâd  
blog about it and show people how I did it.

If I created a cool geo utility class to help perform geolocation  
with one line of code, Iâd share that implementation on the  
blog.

â¦ and then this one â¦ **this one is the hidden gem:**

If I ran into an error in programming that had no results on any  
of the search engines, Iâd blog about how I finally fixed it.  
Letâs say the error message was âCM00234 Not Found During  
Processingâ. Iâd title my blog post: âHow to Fix: CM00234 Found  
During Processingâ and then Iâd show people how I fixed it in my  
situation.

Guess what?

Do you know who ranked #1 on Google for âCM00234 Not Found During  
Processingâ? (This is not a real blog post, just an example).

My blog.

If you want to see a real-world example, Google this â[Syntax  
Highlighting for .build and .msbuildâ](https://www.google.com/search?q=Syntax+Highlighting+for+.build+and+.msbuild)

**Guess whoâs #1 on Google?**

**My blog.**

_That post is 12 years old._ Yes, there is even a broken image that  
is on that page and itâs super old, but this illustrates how you  
can rank your content easily.

_This is known as long tail keyword ranking._

Long tail keywords are very specific and you have a higher chance  
of rating higher on Google.

**Guess what happens when you rank higher on Google?**

**More exposure.**

_What happens when you get more exposure?_ More people know about  
you.

This is a fantastic way to start blogging. Simply share what  
youâve worked on, and how it worked for you or share a fix to an  
error that was very tricky that you could not find an answer for  
online. Most likely, others are running into this as well and  
they canât find a solution. Posting your solution on your blog  
will help them out.

This will lead to more exposure, FOR YOU.

This is a good thing â¦ let me tell you a quick story before I  
wrap up â¦

In 2009, my first full-time independent contract was coming to a  
close. I was getting paid $90 an hour as a web dev. I was  
blogging one to two times a week using this method above (sharing  
what I learned, how to fix errors, etc) and all of a sudden I got  
a cold email from a guy named Jesse from the contact form on my  
blog. Jesse worked as a contractor at GMAC (now known as Ally  
Bank). He saw that I was writing about some of the stuff they  
were dealing with at GMAC and asked if I had any capacity to help  
them.

A week later I had lunch with their team to see if it was a fit  
(it was a mini interview for the team and to gauge my knowledge)  
and I was a fit! In about 2-3 weeks I started working at GMAC for  
$125 an hour. â a 28% raise â¦ from a blog post. This contract  
lasted almost two years and then I eventually wrote the Android  
book and moved onto Android consulting.

Iâve seen this happen to MANY people over the years. MANY.

Long story short â this ONLY happened because of my blog. Jesse  
was a reader of my blog and saw that I knew what I was talking  
about. I was simply sharing the knowledge that I had learned from  
coding and doing my day to day duties. This turned into an  
opportunity â a very lucrative one.

So yeah â¦ my blog does make money.

How?

Exposure.

It exposed what I knew to Jesse, through some indirect way â he  
found it online, perhaps through a search, someone sending a link  
to him, who knows. I still donât know to this day how he found  
it. That led to him emailing me and then before I knew it, I was  
working with him and his team.

If I had NOT been blogging, I would not be in the position I am  
in now. Iâm not saying this exact thing is going to happen to  
you, but I do know a blog has helped my career immensely and Iâve  
seen it help others in fantastic ways too.

Which brings me to â¦

The two best things Iâve ever done in my career has been to start  
blogging and start speaking â Iâm sure youâre starting to see why  
now.

If you donât have a blog, there are many places you can set them  
up. Some are great, others â¦ not-so-much. Iâll talk about the  
various options you have in the next email â stay tuned.

If you havenât written anything for your blog in a while, or if  
your not sure even what youâd talk about please hit the comment section below and let know. Iâd love to learn how I can help you get it started.
