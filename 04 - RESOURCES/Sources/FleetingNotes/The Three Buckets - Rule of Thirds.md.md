I learned one simple thing years ago that helped me more than I think anything else Iâve learned in awhile.

What is it?

> You canât make everyone happy.

Iâve tried. It just doesnât work.

When you do try to make everyone happy you eventually end up feeling **defeated and burned out**. At the end of the day youâve wasted part of your life on trying to please people who do not want to be pleased.

I eventually learned to accept what I call the rule of thirds. Iâm not the first one to come up with this, but it is very useful so I thought Iâd share it here.

### The Three Buckets (The Rule of Thirds)

The rule of thirds is a mental system which you can apply to your day to day life to help alleviate the mental load of worrying about making everyone happy.

**The rule of thirds is as follows â¦  
**When you create something in life (a business, products, a presentation, public speaking, an idea, something at work, etc â it doesnât matter .. its anything) people are going to react in one of three ways:

-   Positive â 1/3 of people are going toÂ be positive about it
-   Indifferent â 1/3 of people are going to be indifferent about it
-   Negative â 1/3 of people are going to be negative aboutÂ it

As soon as you realize that this is the way the world works, the easier things become.

Give a presentation on XYZ Topic at your local MeetUp? Most may like it, some may hate it, and some are indifferent.

You canât make everyone happy â¦ and thatâs ok.

Thats why this world is great. We all have different opinions, emotions and things we enjoy. Everyone is unique.

So the next time someone trolls you online about something youâve done, **just realize what bucket theyâre in and move on with your life**.Â Donât let it disrupt your day.
