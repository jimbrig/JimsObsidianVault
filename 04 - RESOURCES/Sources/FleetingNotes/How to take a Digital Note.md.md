# How to take a Digital Note

![](https://i.imgur.com/0MHK6wP.png)


## What to take a digital note of

1.  **Inspiring** (for me in the future?)
    1.  For instance a TESTIMONIAL notebook to be picked up
2.  **Useful**
    1.  Source, building block, tools
    2.  Use best practices to not reinvent things pre-existing
3.  **Easily lost**
    1.  Things unlikely to find in the future? (uses questions to set criteria)
4.  **Personal**
    1.  Unique, hard-won knowledge worth revisiting over the years
