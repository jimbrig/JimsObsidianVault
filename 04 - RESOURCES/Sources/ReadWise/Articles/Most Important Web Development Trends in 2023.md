## Highlights
- Trend #1. AI driven development ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4n7wj1k3rj441h2q1rwsf))
- With the recent boom of AI tools at your disposal for Web Development and tech as a whole, it raises the question: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4nb6j4tywa5366a70z0jk))
- This technology spans much further than just code. Essentially it's a chat bot that can answer any question that your heart desires. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4ngyhqvacbqpqkcsf4gqz))
- However, there are flaws with it, in that it's too powerful for most users to use effectively. Ask the wrong thing, and it will try to find and makeup a working solution - even if the answer is not technically correct or true. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4nkn8v59jjjy4ns07xp75))
- Our take is that AI development tools are here to stay. This isn't just the next fad. So they are something you should definitely start learning more in 2023. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4nqkce16194p0k8jxzn20))
- If you don't, other programmers definitely will and likely leave you in their dust. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4nvb3nay8kzh85e17kqvz))
- We predict that within the next 12 months, programmers using these tools effectively will be 10x more effective than those who don't. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4nvb6hk6bzx6hfpzjh35t))
- Trend #2. End-to-end type safety ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4pgwh62fvcpgr2vr7s1az))
- Type safety is a property inside a program that ensures all value types are known at build time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4pqadevneevdxvb2m8nv8))
- The goal of this is to help kill any bugs before the program even runs, and it comes as standard when using TypeScript with any project. End-to-end type safety is a whole other story though. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4ptgcr6j1w6ceh4860ycy))
- Simply put, when you’re forced to specifically declare a type to each variable, it becomes easier for you or other developers on your team to understand the intended behavior of your code. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4pzx5q4j83pdctmx9bk69))
- Not only that, but it also saves you time by catching errors early on in the development process. This becomes even more prevalent when you're working on a massive project or complex code base. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4q2x9f3hkw9enptcakbmx))
- Trend #3. The rise of meta frameworks ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4q2xecgfw3bwcxsxy79m1))
- For those that don’t know, a meta framework is best described as a ‘framework of frameworks’. It essentially has everything you need to build your application: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4q7aa5qwj69s4hbvrkf7e))
- Routing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4qbgjn52czx6bdtz3qx9y))
- Server-side rendering ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4qcfvhfz70rvbj2a8pdrh))
- Data fetching ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4qnmj35qhyykeg438r8a1))
- Serverless architecture ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4qenxg0jfdj4s6v89q3az))
- API routes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4qg21crdvjsvv7nandp35))
- Built-in optimizations and more! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4qhqzv8dyrk1znqa5bqja))
- To put this into perspective. When I was first learning to code, I learned what is called the MERN stack. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4qs47ffewemfjqzymb50t))
- MongoDB ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4qzgb2cs2mxrjdmtjectf))
- Express ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4r1peb6tttmpmvfvzt4q0))
- [React](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/learn-react/), and ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4r3qkzbjs7f6v4yes0ct6))
- Now, this works and it’s great but let’s be honest here. **These are not an ‘all-in-one’ solution, and that’s where Meta frameworks come in**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4rmbbvb55ngsnq2v5hpt7))
- Frameworks like: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4rpsv62zctzhjth72pzrq))
- Astro ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4rrtm4nq5fjj845p4jj5d))
- Redwood ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4rxqxg1ebz78mhrv99kf7))
- Sveltekit, and ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4rxx70d1msmf1vwas6a3d))
- Next.js ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4rxxx719bdzxdgq7scv77))
- Trend #4. Server-side rendering ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4s3wy9ptfs4j6d073mrnq))
- That’s right, history is repeating itself like it always does, and SSR or server-side rendering is back again and steadily growing in popularity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4s638177c7sdeaymb4g0h))
- Client-side rendering ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4sd21rz7dth3zc2xdpanx))
- Client-side rendering is where a page is built on the browser and has its own pros and cons. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4sh9xraj32nv4fray742k))
- It renders quickly after the initial page load up, and all future loads. But, the con of course is that the initial load up is pretty slow. Not great for a first experience with a site or app. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4sha4ypkqym93b9b20n1q))
- CSR is also great with progressive web apps, but it’s not great for websites and marketing. If you have an SEO first focus or want to run paid traffic to a site, you’re going to struggle with CSR and not be able to track any results thanks to privacy blockers and other issues. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4shpjfs7aj9k57wqrc15c))
- Trend #5. Serverless architecture ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4ss69bhsx5bq0mrj2qcyr))
- Trend #6. Core web vitals ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4ssxy0pqvh29ap38v21j1))
- Created by Google in 2020 to measure user experience, CWV has quickly become the standard measurement for site performance and opportunities to improve. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4swjznfgxt9yecnzdt7ee))
- Although it’s not currently stated to be a metric that directly affects ranking results, if your site fails to meet the standards then it’s usually a sign that you will struggle. Slow sites would mean higher bounce rate and less traffic etc. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4szaj00et28fmn5am6678))
- Google is also a big fan of making these types of things optional at first and then compulsory later down the line. So getting on top of this now and designing with it in mind is the smart thing to do. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4t3t1ggq9x48v6vmwj5ny))
- Don’t try and learn everything. Focus on the right things instead! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzq4t40t8a1kn4bwfe8fwzzd))
