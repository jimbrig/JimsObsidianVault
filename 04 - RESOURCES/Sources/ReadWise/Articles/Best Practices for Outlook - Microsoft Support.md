## Highlights
- Basic principles of good time management
- Reduce the number of places where you read messages. If you're using a new version of Microsoft 365, you can use Focused Inbox for Outlook to automatically separate the types of messages you're most likely to read right away from other messages.
- Let some messages pass by. Use rules to send the messages that you don't need to read right away into their own folders. Such as folders for projects or Contact Group folders. You don’t need to — and in high volume situations probably can’t — read every message sent to you.
- Reduce the number of places where you manually file messages. Reduce the mental tax of filing by relying on search to locate messages.
- Process your messages by using the Four Ds. When reading your messages, decide whether to:
  Delete it.
  Do it (respond or file for reference).
  Delegate it (forward).
  Defer it (using categories and flags) for a second review in your task list.
- Reduce your to-do list to one list. Use a single to-do list and a single calendar to manage what you need to do.
- Work in batches. Use categories to help you group similar tasks together.
- Use good judgment when sending messages. Follow the do’s and don’ts of writing great messages.
- Review your calendar and tasks regularly.
- Setting up Outlook: The layout
    - Tags: [[green]] 
- The Navigation Pane open on the left.
  Your messages in Conversations view, with messages sent directly to you automatically formatted in blue.
  The Reading Pane on the right.
  The To-Do Bar open on the far right. If your screen resolution is less than 1024 by 768 pixels, the To-Do Bar can be minimized.
  Cached Exchange Mode turned on.
- Folders
    - Tags: [[green]] 
- It’s considered best practice to have:
  An Inbox for messages that you need to process (deal with). Your Inbox is for messages sent directly to you or that could be important for you to read.
- If you receive many messages that go back and forth among several different people, change to Conversations view. Otherwise, use the date arrangement (the default arrangement). Use automatic formatting rules to make all messages sent only to you blue.
- A single reference folder, under the Inbox, for all reference material that you might want to refer back to later. Nothing is automatically filed (that is, with a rule) into this folder. Name this folder 1-Reference. (Adding the 1- will cause it to be the first item under the Inbox.) This folder is created under the Inbox so that you can collapse the Inbox and remove it from view.
- A folder for career-related, private, and personal messages. Having a separate folder for personal and career-related information gives you the freedom to search for a message while someone is standing over your shoulder without worrying that a personally sensitive message will appear. Name this folder 2-Personal. Managers might have a single folder for feedback on their employees called 3-Management.
- A set of folders for Contact Group messages. All messages sent to Contact Groups (also known as list servers, or mailing lists, or distribution lists) don’t necessarily need to be read. This set of folders is the repository for all of the Contact Group messages that aren’t automatically delivered to your Inbox. Create a single, top-level folder under your Inbox called Contact Groups, and then create a subfolder for each topic of Contact Groups. Usually, one folder per Contact Group is enough, but if you are on several related Contact Groups, consider having all of the messages delivered to the same folder.
- Search folders
    - Tags: [[green]] 
- Search folders are useful for gathering information from across different mail and RSS folders. Search folders can be especially useful when you need to gather information that is saved in different folders — for example, when preparing for a quarterly meeting.
  If you receive a large volume of messages (more than 200 messages a day), search folders might be a good way for you to parse mail from different senders.
- Categories
    - Tags: [[green]] 
- Categories in Outlook allow you to manage items in many different ways. There are three main types of categories that we recommend creating:
  Project (can include people)
  Topic
  Location or activity
- Categories aren’t a required aspect of this system, but they will make your life easier if you are diligent about using them. For example, they can help you more easily identify what you can do now and help you group similar tasks so that you can do them all at once.
- It’s considered best practice to have a category for:
    - Tags: [[green]] 
- Each of your direct reports and your manager for items that you want to review the next time you meet (for example, a category named 1:1 Manager).
    - Note: 1:1 Peichung, 1:1 Yusuf, 1:1 Zane, etc
- Each of the major locations or types of activities that you do, so that you can perform bulk actions (a useful part of managing your tasks), for example:
  @Commute for tasks that you can do on the way home from work.
  @Email for tasks that involve email messages, meetings, or any other aspect of Outlook.
  @Home for tasks that you can do only at home.
  @Meeting for items that you need in order to prepare for a meeting.
  @Offline for tasks that take you away from the computer, such as making a copy of a document.
  @Online for tasks that you can accomplish only online or through a Web browser.
  @Phone for calls you have to make or receive.
  @Read for tasks that involve just reading — not responding. This category is useful for long messages or attachments that you need to read but can’t get to right away.
  @Waiting for messages or tasks for which you are awaiting a response, but there is no explicit next action for you.
    - Note: @Waiting, @Agendas, @Personal, @Read, @Email
- Each important topic or project so that you can easily find messages on a given topic — especially if there is no word in the body or subject of the message that would make it appear in a search.
    - Note: @Project: ASTP, @Project: Ameritas, @Project: Climate, @Project: RezMod, @Project: APA, @Project: Aflac, @Project: Renre, @Dev: DevOps, @Dev: Azure, @Dev: Data
- Important items that must be done today and can’t roll over to another day.
