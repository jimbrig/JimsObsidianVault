## Highlights
- There are lots more keyboard shortcuts than these. You can typically discover them by hovering the action with your mouse pointer, pulling open the Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`), or tapping `?` for the quick reference. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhzt9qbw0ecemeqqkh5sg4v))
- You can save documents of all kinds to Reader including web articles, RSS feeds, email newsletters, PDFs, EPUBs, Twitter threads, Twitter Lists, and YouTube videos, bringing all your reading into one place. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhztt9khja6jp8swsnzajqg))
- It's also a web highlighter. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhzvv1n627dgv1daexyc7ba))
- This means you can optionally highlight the native web page, just like with Hypothes.is or Liner. And those highlights will bidirectionally sync with the Reader web and mobile apps. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhzvy241j0vndey0jr3gx3x))
- **Double tap to highlight.** The mobile analog of using the keyboard shortcut `h` to highlight an entire paragraph is double tapping. If you're reading this on mobile, try double tapping this paragraph. It's awesome. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhzxeeekvcpz4pd1vry1hm9))
- YouTube highlighting ðŸŽ¥ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhzxqddkgdmjftbkaa3d8fy))
- Another feature that might seem out of place in a product called Reader, but is very much worth mentioning here is highlighting YouTube videos. Ultimately, Readwise is about betterment and YouTube has evolved into perhaps the best learning content platform in existence. Yet until now, there weren't many digital solutions to capture ideas and take notes while you watch. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhzxs2nkmawxhp8h3dezm04))
- In Reader, you can watch a YouTube video alongside its time-synced transcript, and take notes and highlights as it plays. You can also precisely navigate the video by clicking any fragment, clicking a highlight in the right sidebar, or using special keyboard controls.

- As you start using Reader, you'll notice there are two broad "sections" for your documents: Library and Feed. You might then wonder, why two sections? Why not just one? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhzy8njkrhtpw7akyzk60as))
- Think of the Library section as your permanent archive of digital documents: a place of high signal and low noise. Library is where documents that you manually save for yourself, such as clipping an article with the browser extension, reside. These documents can then be managed through the triage statuses of Inbox (for newly saved documents), Later (for documents you intend to read but don't have time right now), and Archive (for documents you're finished with at the moment). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhzybmbpgghfzm76520c70f))
- The Feed section, on the other hand, is where documents that are automatically "pushed" to you by others, such as RSS subscriptions and email newsletters, initially reside: a place of low signal and high noise. You can, of course, save something from Feed to Library for safekeeping, but this is an intentional choice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhzys2wv70gjazspkpgrwxr))
- Try it now by opening the Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`), starting to type "feedback", choosing Suggest improvement, and saying something like "hello!" ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhzzgwj9dpdvfgxkjvm1hjt))
- PS- If you like help documentation, you should find an FAQ in your Reader account if you search! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhzzs17aavqppenqcsdfx48))
