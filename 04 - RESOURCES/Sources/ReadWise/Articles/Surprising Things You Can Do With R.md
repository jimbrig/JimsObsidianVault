## Highlights
- R has had a significant impact on a wide range of data science fields, from machine learning and artificial intelligence to data visualization and analysis.
- 1. Create and Customize Dashboards and Data Visualizations
  Without data visualization, understanding your data is virtually difficult. Data visualization converts the information you’ve collected and evaluated into understandable visual content, such as pictures and graphs.
- 2. More Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis
  Performing exploratory data analysis is a prerequisite for the majority of data science tasks. The same procedures that you would use to describe a dataset are covered by exploratory data analysis.
- 3. Perform More Scientifically Rigorous Data Analysis
  You’ll need the means to ensure that your data analysis is rigorously scientific if you want to learn and master the R programming language. 
  Statistics are exactly what you need to make sure that your data analysis adheres to scientific rigor, and R is the language you can use to make use of several statistical tools.
- 4. Make More Accurate Predictions with Machine Learning
  It’s understandable why machine learning is one of the subjects that the data science community discusses the most. 
  Data scientists and analysts may automate the process through which they derive critical insights, spot data trends, and create extremely precise predictive models thanks to machine learning. 
  The best thing, though? To harness the potential of machine learning, you don’t need to employ explicitly stated programming instructions.
  Machine learning enables data scientists and analysts to make precise and extensive predictions when utilizing the R programming language.
- 5. Use R Markdown Documents to Automate the Reporting
  Working professionals who routinely produce automated presentations and reports are huge fans of the R Markdown package. 
  How come this is the case? This is primarily due to R Markdown’s ability to execute R-written code while a document is being produced.
  R Markdown is a simple and lightweight markup language that is an extension of Markdown. R Markdown takes one step further by supporting the R programming language, whereas Markdown allows users to add things like headers and lists to their pages.
