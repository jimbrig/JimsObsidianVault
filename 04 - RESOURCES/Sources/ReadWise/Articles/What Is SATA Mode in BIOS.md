## Highlights
- Serial Advanced Technology Attachment, also known as Serial ATA or SATA, enables mass storage devices, such as hard drives and optical drives, to communicate with the motherboard using a high-speed serial cable over two pairs of conductors.

- What SATA mode should I use AHCI or RAID? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0195xkc4ftzs4y6yf41vea9))
- If you are using a SATA SSD drive, AHCI may be more suitable than RAID. If you are using multiple hard drives, RAID is a better choice. If you want to use an SSD plus extra HHDs under RAID mode, it’s recommended that you continue using RAID mode. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h01960ksaz28fjtyasjmt1fb))
- What is SATA ATA and AHCI? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0196b78sr67a6tvd43tvgth))
- AHCI stands for Advance Host Controller Interface. It is a newer technology to provide advanced features to the Serial ATA standard. … SATA IDE Compatibility Mode disables AHCI however it will allow you to install older operating systems such as Microsoft’s Windows XP without the need to install AHCI controller drivers.

- What is AHCI mode in BIOS? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0196ge1dg4te8sa6ynnka71))
- AHCI – a new mode for memory devices, where a computer can use all SATA advantages, primarily higher speed of data exchange with SSD and HDD (Native Command Queuing technology, or NCQ), as well as hot swapping of hard disks.

- Is Ahci bad for SSD? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0196stg0yyekpdadz41mxap))
- AHCI mode as previously explained enables NCQ (native command queuing) which is really not required for SSDs as they do not need optimizing in this way as there is no physical movement of heads or platters. In many cases, it can actually hinder SSD performance, and even reduce the lifetime of your SSD. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0196wv09gvnnxmgr97et15r))
- Can I change from RAID to AHCI without reinstalling Windows? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h01978xc7q5hc8pjqrd8x8h1))
- There is in fact a way to switch operation from either IDE / RAID to AHCI within Windows 10 without having to reinstall. … Change the SATA Operation mode to AHCI from either IDE or RAID. Save changes and exit Setup and Windows will automatically boot to Safe Mode. Right-click the Windows Start Menu once more.

- Do I need to change BIOS settings for SSD? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0197n1e5nd0zj54p7aqxmyz))
- For ordinary, SATA SSD, that’s all you need to do in BIOS. Just one advice not tied to SSDs only. Leave SSD as first BOOT device, just change to CD using fast BOOT choice (check your MB manual which F button is for that) so you don’t have to enter BIOS again after first part of windows installation and first reboot.

- What is the difference between ATA and SATA? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0197tnb2ksw03q9dvm282q5))
- SATA stands for serial ATA and is basically a technologically advanced ATA drive with a few advantages. With data transfer rates reaching and exceeding 600MB/s, SATA can be much faster and more efficient than the 133MB/s capabilities of ATA drives. … ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0197xpqxb6yqnn5m2spj4kd))
- What is UEFI mode? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h01980mq3fev39enqrwqkd4m))
- The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. … UEFI can support remote diagnostics and repair of computers, even with no operating system installed.
