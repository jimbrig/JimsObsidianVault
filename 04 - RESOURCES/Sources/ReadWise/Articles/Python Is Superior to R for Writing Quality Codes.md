## Highlights
- Python is superior to R for writing quality codes!. R is good for short and dirty analysis, but Python is better if you want to perform significant work, we frequently hear or read.
- We vehemently disagree with this claim because it is entirely feasible to develop production-quality code in R; we have done it, and others can do it as well.
- You can consider a language’s intrinsic properties, such as its language constructs, syntax, functions, and available libraries when contrasting it with another.
- However, you may also take a more empirical approach by rapidly displaying all the instances of the code written in either of the two languages that you have come across.
- The common consensus is that excellent code should be legible (well documented, follow a consistent style,…), modular, reusable, dependable, tested, and, of course, do what it is intended to do.
- The majority of R users are trained scientists. 
  They frequently learn how to program in R on their own (the best resources for learning R are Google and YouTube! ), and even when they did receive formal instruction, it was typically only very brief and most likely included in a statistics lesson (exception made of professional statisticians and data scientists).
  Additionally, they are probably unfamiliar with proper coding methods because they were probably not introduced to general computer science courses and concepts.
- Again, professional statisticians and data scientists stand out as an important exception because they frequently produce high-quality code that is made available as R packages on CRAN and other repositories because developing statistical and machine-learning methodology and tools is one of their primary tasks.
- The majority of Python users have a background in computing. Python is frequently used at colleges as a medium to introduce computer science ideas. 
  Python users probably received some formal instruction in Python programming even if they didn’t have a degree in computer science because it was necessary for them to get the job.
- Python is typically used by software developers, whose primary responsibility is writing code. 
  The program is designed to be executed repeatedly on various machines (and maybe even operating systems), with various data sets. 
  The code often handles failures gracefully, is resilient and reliable, and can handle rare circumstances. 
  Additionally, it is anticipated that the code will need to be maintained (bug fixing, adaption, evolution), maybe by other people. 
  As a result, the concepts of documentation, style, readability, and reuse naturally become a part of the development process. 
  Taking everything into account, we can claim that “average” Python code will frequently adhere to excellent coding standards.
