## Highlights
- Office Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is an event-driven programming language that enables you to extend Office applications.
- The great power of VBA programming in Office is that nearly every operation that you can perform with a mouse, keyboard, or a dialog box can also be automated by using VBA. Further, if it can be done once with VBA, it can be done just as easily a hundred times. In fact, the automation of repetitive tasks is one of the most common uses of VBA in Office.
