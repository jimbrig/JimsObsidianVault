## Highlights
- But as I turned the pages of Carroll’s book, he introduced me to ideas that profoundly changed how I think about notes, journaling, productivity, and even what it means to live a good life.
- Here are my 10 favorite quotes from The Bullet Journal Method, including how each one shaped my thinking.
- #1 – Find your place in the digital age
- The Bullet Journal Method is for anyone struggling to find their place in the digital age.
- Self-reflective practices like BuJo give us a way to ground ourselves in our most important values and principles before we step outside into the information maelstrom.
- #2 – Connect with what you want
- My [ADD] simply forced me to address something early on that has since become a common malady of the digital age: the lack of self-awareness.
- lack of self-awareness.
- We buy tools and download apps to change how we feel inside. This sometimes works briefly, but doesn’t affect the fundamental issue – our relationship with our selves. When we are disconnected from who we are, what we want, and what is important to us, no external change truly makes a difference.Carroll’s words remind me that as much as I enjoy taking in information from the outside world, my true north lies within me.
- #3 – Treat each new idea as an experiment
- Think back to a book, a speech, or a quotation that deeply touched you or changed the way you thought about life. It was wisdom that inspired you, that held so much promise. All you had to do was act on this newfound knowledge and things would get easier, better, clearer, more empowering.
- Now, how much of this knowledge is still in play—not just intellectually, but practically? Did you become a better person, friend, or mate? Did you keep the weight off? Are you happier? Chances are what you learned has withered, if it survived at all. It’s not that it wasn’t helpful. It just didn’t stick. Why is that?
- #4 – Pay attention to what resonates
- We can’t be true to ourselves if we don’t know what we want, and more importantly why, so that’s where we must begin. It’s a process that requires the steady cultivation of our self-awareness
- This may seem very woo-woo, but it can be as simple as paying attention to what resonates with us, what sparks our interest—and, just as importantly, what does not. As we begin to identify the things we’re drawn to, we can start properly defining our dreams, based on what we actually believe in
- But there is a simpler, more “bottom up” way of understanding ourselves: paying attention to and moving toward what resonates with us. This can happen on the scale of a year, a month, a week, or a minute. Every moment is an opportunity to move toward some things and away from other things.
- #5 – Study your mistakes
- By recording our lives, we’re simultaneously creating a rich archive of our choices and our actions for future reference. We can study our mistakes and learn from them. It’s equally instructive to note our successes, our breakthroughs. When something works professionally or personally, it helps to know what our circumstances were at the time and what choices we made. Studying our failures and our victories can provide tremendous insight, guidance, and motivation as we plot our way forward.
- I had never thought of my notes as a “decision log,” but that is absolutely what it is.Our memory is notoriously weak, and that includes our memory of the circumstances surrounding our past decisions. What were the factors that led to that decision? What other options did I weigh? What were the potential risks and pitfalls I wanted to avoid? What goals or outcomes were most important to me?As Carroll notes, these questions are equally valuable when applied to our successes as to our failures. The goal is not just to win, but to understand what winning means to us and what we are willing to invest in order to achieve it.
- #6 – Start small and build from there
- If at some point you feel overwhelmed, take a step back and start by implementing only the pieces that make sense. Most components are self-contained by design, so you can effectively use them even if you don’t use the rest. Start with what speaks to you—even if it’s just one piece—and build from there.
- #7 – Keep your filter a little loose
- Notes include facts, ideas, thoughts, and observations. They log information you want to remember that isn’t immediately or necessarily actionable. This type of bullet works well for meetings, lectures, and classrooms
- I strongly recommend an “actionable” approach to managing information. For me, the only thing that justifies all the time and effort of notetaking is having practical use cases for that information
- #8 – Keep your notes short
- By keeping your Notes short, you’re forced to distill information down to the essential. The more content you try to capture during a lecture or a meeting, the less you’re thinking about what’s being said.
- I also talk extensively about the importance of distillation in my book. As information gets distilled, it becomes more potent, more usable, and more valuable. This quote reminds me that distillation doesn’t have to happen as a late stage of my workflow. Especially as my discernment grows, I can often distill something right at the moment of capturing it, saving me tons of future effort down the line.
- #9 – Keep your future self in mind
- Keep your future self in mind. Your Notes will be useless if they can’t be deciphered in a week, month, or year from now.
- #10 – Start with yourself
- To be useful, you must become useful, especially to yourself. You can’t improve the world around you if you can’t improve the world within.
