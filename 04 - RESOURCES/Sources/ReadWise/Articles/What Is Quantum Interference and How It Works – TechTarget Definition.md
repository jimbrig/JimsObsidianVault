## Highlights
- Quantum interference is when subatomic particles interact with and influence themselves and other particles while in a probabilistic [superposition](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/superposition) state. It can influence the probability of the outcomes when the quantum state is measured. Quantum interference, along with quantum [entanglement](https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/entanglement), is essential to the operation of [quantum computers](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/quantum-computing).
  Quantum interference is similar to interference in other types of waves. For example, imagine dropping two stones in a still pond of water creating two ripples, or sets of waves, in the pond. In some places, the high points, or crests, of two waves collide, resulting in a larger wave. In other places, the high point of one wave collides with the low point, or trough, of another wave, and the two cancel out.
  In a quantum system, the particles exist as a probability wave of possible positions. These probability waves can interact so that, when the system is measured, some outcomes are more likely and other outcomes are less likely. This is known as an *interference pattern*. When the waves reinforce each other, it is called *constructive interference*. When they cancel each other out, it is called *destructive interference*.
