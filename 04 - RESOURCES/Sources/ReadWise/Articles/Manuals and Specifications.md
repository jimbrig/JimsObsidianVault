## Highlights
- [The ECMA-262 specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) contains the most in-depth, detailed and formalized information about JavaScript. It defines the language. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0fg2my28dvc9r9sckv6g9yz))
- A new specification version is released every year. Between these releases, the latest specification draft is at [https://tc39.es/ecma262/](https://tc39.es/ecma262/). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0fg2yr18b3jn8ydyc0gfzae))
- To read about new bleeding-edge features, including those that are “almost standard” (so-called “stage 3”), see proposals at [https://github.com/tc39/proposals](https://github.com/tc39/proposals). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0fg319dghjer8ewrx394vdq))
- Also, if you’re developing for the browser, then there are other specifications covered in the [second part](https://javascript.info/browser-environment) of the tutorial. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0fg3dx4xf339c1gxb7hk4xs))
- **MDN (Mozilla) JavaScript Reference** is the main manual with examples and other information. It’s great to get in-depth information about individual language functions, methods etc. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0fg3g8xdws53gsdw4p1fdpj))
- You can find it at [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0fg3ja3xv6vp4qaqgj9ty8r))
- Although, it’s often best to use an internet search instead. Just use “MDN [term]” in the query, e.g. [https://google.com/search?q=MDN+parseInt](https://google.com/search?q=MDN+parseInt) to search for the `parseInt` function. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0fg3w0sd42x1mbmj55bwf7r))
- [https://caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com) – per-feature tables of support, e.g. to see which engines support modern cryptography functions: [https://caniuse.com/#feat=cryptography](https://caniuse.com/#feat=cryptography). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0fg44t9w0hdw2a0hqrfbbsw))
- [https://kangax.github.io/compat-table](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table) – a table with language features and engines that support those or don’t support. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0fg46sctb2xff5s8s089efd))
