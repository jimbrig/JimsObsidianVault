## Highlights
- People choose videos because are to lazy to learn, they prefer just hear something and do it the easy way.
- The best way to learn something if you already have the basic knowledge are: Articles, Docs, Forums, Communities..., that is, all forms of reading and seek knowledge by yourself are better than depending on other people in videos and lessons.
- Stop settling with the easy, the basic, the comfort zone. If only watching videos or lessons were right way, everyone would be good... be different, be the attention, do the unexpected, the useful, do what really works...
- In short, switch from time-consuming methods to ones where you can manage your time yourself and use it for the things you need that matter.
