## Highlights
- As a programmer I strive to be logical. Logic, after all, is a key component of being a good software developer. In good software development, there’s no room for guesses or emotional decisions – only logical decisions make good software.
- Because “logical thinking” yields such good results when developing software, it makes sense to apply it in other parts of your job. After all, it becomes almost innate after a while. We’re programmers. We’re always logical. It’s just what we do. So, communication, documentation, testing, business analysis, design and all the other aspects of the development become logic driven. Usually, this isn’t a problem, in fact, it’s usually a benefit.
- (Your pet pomeranian who sits in your lap while you work at home doesn’t count.) It can be easy to just approach job-related personal interactions like we would anything else: with logic
- There’s really two big things to change about the message: first, take away the personal aspect. Notice that message says “you broke service such-and-such on QA”. That “you” is a problem. This seems like you’re criticizing the individual, which just naturally makes us humans less receptive. A simple statement of fact is less abrasive. For instance, consider this version: “Service such-and-such is broken on QA. I’ve tried multiple times with these parameters, and it only returns 500s. Please push a fix ASAP.” This is better, but it still comes off a bit accusatory, hence, a second revision is needed. Let me explain.
- This is where the second aspect I mentioned comes in: humility. You think the problem is that someone else broke the such-and-such service on QA, but, in reality, as logical as we all think we are, there’s still a possibility that we got it wrong. Humility is difficult – it’s not innate to some of us. If it’s not, you may have to learn to fake it until you make it. (Wait! Don’t shut this article down because I just adapted a painfully overused cliché!) It’s best to phrase your communications with humility, rather than an air of certainty. This does two things: one, it makes your message a little more palatable to the receiver, and two, it saves you some embarrassment if you do turn out to be wrong. Frankly, life’s just easier with a little humility.
- We don’t want the developer we’re messaging to see only the question “Do those parameters look correct to you?
