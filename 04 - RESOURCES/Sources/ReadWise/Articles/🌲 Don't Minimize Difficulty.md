## Highlights
- Like Luhmann, I prefer to focus on things that are fun, not a chore.
- The metaphor for Obsidian is that a lot of things are easy only if you've put in the time and energy and effort to already know all of the underlying things like how to use a command line tool or how to take notes. Even things like how to read attentively instead of focusing on the words requires fundamental skills not everyone easily masters â€” perhaps because of a learning disability, or perhaps because they never needed the skill before. I've discussed the difficulty of teaching notetaking before, but the core principles apply to many other things, including programming. I Â had this epiphany when I read this article in defense of complicated programming languages, particularly the line about how hard it is to get people to learn something they don't need just because it might be useful later down the line. The author was talking about how video game designers are taught to "show locked doors before you show the key" and how the author struggled to figure out a particular quirk of how python's complex classes helps with code maintainability... because he'd never had to maintain a complex codebase at that stage of his education.
- ...all the other things that you don't need to know in order to use Obsidian, but people talk about a lot. Like python classes, they can help with the maintainability of your systems, and they often come up when you're swimming in the same waters as people who have been casually writing bash scripts to solve problems for themselves for the last 15 years, or who think that autohotkey scripts are intuitive, and that using text expanders in general are something that of course everyone does.
- Further, I'd argue that if you're struggling to figure out why something as "simple" as a zettelkasten system ("it's just like index cards, they used to teach this method in grade school") or "maps of content" or github or discord or dataview queries ("it's just like mysql") or CSS or markdown syntax (which programmers love because it's "so straightforward and uncluttered") ......doesn't feel simple at all, don't feel bad. Don't give up. Just remind yourself that sometimes people communicate in unhelpful ways, and have different backgrounds. Focus less on how easy something seems like it should be and where possible, try to find people to learn from who have similar situations and backgrounds to you, because it's often less frustrating.
