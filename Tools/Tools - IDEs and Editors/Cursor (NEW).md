## Overview

> [!NOTE] About
> *Cursor is a new AI-first code editor built from [[Visual Studio Code]].*

Recently I discovered **Cursor**, a new AI-driven, [[ChatGPT]] style [[Integrated Development Editor]] (IDE) that combines [[Natural Language Processing]] capabilities with traditional [[programming tools]] to create an interactive and intuitive coding experience.

The goal of cursor is to make the development process more efficient and accessible by leveraging AI-assisted features.

It main highlight is that it uses GPT-4 to assist you in programming, and completes operations such as AI intelligently generating code, modifying bugs, and generating tests. For example:

- **Coding**: Generate 10â€“100 lines of code with an AI thatâ€™s smarter than Copilot
- **Check diffs**: Ask the AI to edit a block of code, see only proposed changes
- **ChatGPT-style based**: ChatGPT-style interface that understands your current file
- **More**: ask to fix lint errors, generate tests/comments on hover, etc.

## Getting Started

1. `Ctrl + L`: This allows one to communicate with the built-in AI, similar to ChatGPT interaction.
2. `Ctrl + K`:
