## Discoveries

> Anything relevant that I discovered on this day (i.e. tools, technology, articles, podcasts, videos, people, etc.)

- The [[Momentum Browser Extension]] released a new feature called [Tab Stash](https://get.momentumdash.help/hc/en-us/articles/14474141114391) which seems like a very solid replacement for my current use of the [[OneTab Browser Extension]]: [Introducing Tab Stash · Momentum Dash Blog](https://momentumdash.com/blog/tab-stash)

- Discovered [[asdf]], a [[CLI Tool]] that acts as a version manager for runtimes/tools (manage runtime versions via single `.tool-versions` config)
	- [asdf | asdf (asdf-vm.com)](https://asdf-vm.com/)
	- [Getting Started | asdf (asdf-vm.com)](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)
	- [asdf-vm/asdf: Extendable version manager with support for Ruby, Node.js, Elixir, Erlang & more (github.com)](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf)
	- [asdf-vm/asdf-plugins: Convenience shortname repository for asdf community plugins (github.com)](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins)

- Discovered [[direnv]], a [[CLI Tool]] [[shell extension]] that augments existing shell sessions to load and unload [[environment variables]] depending on the current active working directory. For example, can use a `.envrc` file per-project and it will automatically get loaded when you navigate to the project's folder.
