The **ARIS** concept (**Architecture of Integrated Information Systems**) by [August-Wilhelm Scheer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August-Wilhelm_Scheer "August-Wilhelm Scheer") aims to ensure that an [enterprise information system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_information_system) can completely meet its requirements.

This framework is based on a division of the model into description views and levels, which allows a description of the individual elements through specially designed methods, without having to include the entire model. The methodology serves as a [systems development life cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle "Systems development life cycle") for mapping and optimizing business processes. These processes are mapped for each description view, starting with the business management question up to the implementation on data processing level.

ARIS relies mainly on its own five-view [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture "Architecture") (ARIS house). These five views are based on organization, data, service, functional and process views of a process. The classification is made to break down the complexity of the model into five facets and thus make [business process modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_modeling "Business process modeling") simpler.

Each view of the ARIS concept represents the model of a business process under a specific aspect:

- _Function view_: The activities, groupings and hierarchical relationships that exist between them are described in the function view, for example in a [function tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_tree "Function tree").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Integrated_Information_Systems#cite_note-2) Since functions support goals and are controlled by them, goals are also assigned to the function view
- _Organization view:_ This provides an overview of the organizational structure of a company, including human resources, machines, hardware and their relationships, see also [Organizational chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organigram "Organigram")
- _Data view:_ This includes all events (that generate data) and environmental data, such as correspondence, documents, etc., i.e. all company-relevant information objects, see also [Entity Relationship Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model "Entity–relationship model")
- _Product/Service view:_ Provides an overview of the entire product/service portfolio (incl. services, products, financial)
- _Process view_: The process view connects all other views into a time-logical schedule, for example in an [event-driven process chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_process_chain "Event-driven process chain") or [BPMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation "Business Process Model and Notation")
