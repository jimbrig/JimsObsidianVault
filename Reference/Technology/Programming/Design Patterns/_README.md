# Design Patterns

> [!NOTE] About
> This folder houses notes regarding [[Design Patterns]] in [[Software Development]]. Design patterns, or [[System Design]] / [[Architectural Patterns]], are general, reusable resolutions to commonly occurring problems in [[Software Architecture]] within a given *context*. The patterns address various issues in [[Software Engineering]], such as [[Computer Hardware]] performance limitations, [[High Availability]], and minimization of a [[Business Risk]]. Some patterns have been implemented within [[Software Frameworks]].

## Definition


Even though an architectural pattern conveys an image of a system, it is not an architecture. An architectural pattern is a concept that solves and delineates some essential cohesive elements of a software architecture. Countless different architectures may implement the same pattern and share the related characteristics. Patterns are often defined as "strictly described and commonly available".
