## Overview

> [!NOTE] About
> *The **MVC** Pattern separates an application into three interconnected components: the **Model**, the **View**, and the **Controller**. The model represents the data and business logic. The View handles the presentation and user interface layer. The Controller acts as the intermediary between the model and the view.*

## Layers

Layers:

- **Model**: represents the data and business logic.
- **View**: presentation and user interface.
- **Controller**: acts as the intermediary between the model and the view.

### Pros and Cons

Pros:

- **Separation of Concerns**: MVC separates different aspects of an application, improving code organization and maintainability.
- **Code Reusability**: The modular structure allows components to be reused across different views.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: The separation of responsibilities enables parallel development by different teams.

Cons:

- **Complexity**: MVC can introduce additional complexity, especially for small projects that donâ€™t require extensive separation of concerns.
- **Potential Code Duplication**: Without proper abstraction and modularization, there is a risk of duplicating code across controllers and views.
- **Steep Learning Curve**: Understanding the flow and responsibilities of each component may require additional learning for developers new to MVC.
