# FSUTIL

> [!NOTE] About
> Windows includes a [[command line]] tool for file, system, and disk management, called **Fsutil**. This utility helps you to change the short name of a file, find files by [SID’s (Security Identifier)](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/what-are-windows-security-identifiers-and-how-to-resolve-sids) and perform other complex tasks.

*See Also: [[Cmd - DISKPART|DISKPART]]*.

[[FSUTIL]] and [[Cmd - DISKPART|DISKPART]] are powerful, but not for inexperienced [[Reference/Technology/Computer Science/Operating System/Windows]] users.
