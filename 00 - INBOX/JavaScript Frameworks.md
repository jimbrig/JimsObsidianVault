## Overview

[[JavaScript]] frameworks are an essential part of modern [[03 - AREAS/Technology/Programming/Web Development/Frontend/_README|Frontend]] [[Web Development]], providing [[MOC - Development|Developers]] with tried and tested tools for building *scalable, interactive web applications*. 

Many modern companies use frameworks as a standard part of their tooling, so many front-end development jobs now require framework experience. In this set of articles, we are aiming to give you a comfortable starting point to help you begin learning frameworks.

As an aspiring front-end developer, it can be hard to work out where to begin when learning frameworks — there are so many frameworks to choose from, new ones appear all the time, they mostly work in a similar way but do some things differently, and there are some specific things to be careful about when using frameworks.

We are not aiming to exhaustively teach you everything you need to know about [[React]]/[[ReactDOM]], or [[03 - AREAS/Technology/Programming/Web Development/Frontend/JavaScript Frameworks/Vue|Vue]] or some other specific framework; the framework teams' own docs (and other resources) do that job already. Instead, we want to back up and first answer more fundamental questions such as:

- Why should I use a framework? What problems do they solve for me?
- What questions should I ask when trying to choose a framework? Do I even need to use a framework?
- What features do frameworks have? How do they work in general, and how do frameworks' implementations of these features differ?
- How do they relate to "vanilla" JavaScript or HTML?

After that, we'll provide some tutorials covering the essentials of some of the different framework choices, to provide you with enough context and familiarity to start going into greater depth yourself. We want you to go forward and learn about frameworks in a pragmatic way that doesn't forget about web platform fundamental best practices such as accessibility.

## Prerequisites

## Introduction

We begin our look at frameworks with a general overview of the area, looking at a brief history of JavaScript and frameworks, why frameworks exist and what they give us, how to start thinking about choosing a framework to learn, and what alternatives there are to client-side frameworks.

| Objective:     | To understand how client-side JavaScript frameworks came to exist, what problems they solve, what alternatives there are, and how to go about choosing one.                                                                              |

### Brief History

When JavaScript debuted in 1996, it added occasional interactivity and excitement to a web that was, up until then, composed of static documents. The web became not just a place to _read things_, but to _do things_. JavaScript's popularity steadily increased. Developers who worked with JavaScript wrote tools to solve the problems they faced, and packaged them into reusable packages called **libraries**, so they could share their solutions with others. This shared ecosystem of libraries helped shape the growth of the web.

Now, JavaScript is an essential part of the web, [used on 98% of all websites](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cp-javascript), and the web is an essential part of modern life. Users write papers, manage their budgets, stream music, watch movies, and communicate with others over great distances instantaneously, with text, audio, or video chat. The web allows us to do things that used to be possible only in native applications installed on our computers. These modern, complex, interactive websites are often referred to as **web applications**.

The advent of modern JavaScript frameworks has made it much easier to build highly dynamic, interactive applications. A **framework** is a library that offers opinions about how software gets built. These opinions allow for predictability and homogeneity in an application; predictability allows the software to scale to an enormous size and still be maintainable; predictability and maintainability are essential for the health and longevity of software.

JavaScript frameworks power much of the impressive software on the modern web – including many of the websites you likely use every day. MDN Web Docs, which you are currently reading this on, uses the React/ReactDOM framework to power its front end.
