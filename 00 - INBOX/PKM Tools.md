# Personal Knowledge Management Software and Tools

While it’s possible to uses just one or two apps for your PKM, I’ve found seeking total simplicity more annoying than efficient. There are certain programs that are just better at handling certain types of data. For example, I use Notion for notetaking. Lots of people use it for project management and/or reference management as well, but it was too hands-on for me for those uses. So I use it for a single thing: taking notes.

In selecting which apps to use, I recommend starting where you are. If your docs are all stored in OneDrive, then use OneDrive as your file repository. If there are pain points (stuff that drives you bananas), then it’s time to look elsewhere for a solution.

Here are the apps I use, along with some alternatives:

1. [[Task Management]] &  [[Project Management]]: **[[03 - AREAS/Technology/Programming/Tools/Productivity Tools/Todoist]]**
2. [[File Management]]: **[[OneDrive]]**
3. [[Knowledge Management]]: **[[Obsidian Chat]]**
4. [[Reference Management]]: **[[Zotero]]**
5. [[Media Management]]: ?
