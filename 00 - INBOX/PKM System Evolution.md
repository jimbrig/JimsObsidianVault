# PKM System Evolution

## Contents

[TOC]

## Overview

> [!NOTE] About
> *Description of note contents.*

## Goals

- *Dissect* my entire [[MOCs/MOC - PKM|Personal Knowledge Management]] system and how it has *evolved* over time. 
- Gain insights and describe the information kept inside the system and where it is stored.
- *Review and audit* all relevant [[Tools]] used in the system and why they are necessary.
- *Describe the process of [[Capturing]], [[Organizing]], and [[Cultivating]] data* in the system and how it all fits together.
- Lastly, describe *the processes necessary to keep the system* **"under control"**.

## Evolution

Like many other digital natives, my Personal Knowledge Management system has evolved a lot over the years. I've accumulated _many_ terabytes of data, and store my information all over the Internet. A gazillion 0s and 1s spread across the entire planet. That growth was organic, but I've made conscious _design_ choices over time to keep things manageable.

## Data Hoarding

### Bookmarks

Structure:

- Bookmarks Bar: *Icons Only*
- 

### RSS Feeds

### Password and Secrets Management

- Online Passwords
- FTP/SSH Server and Database Credentials
- Email Credentials
- API Keys and Secrets
- Cloud Services Credentials
- Banking and Financial
- License / Activation Keys

## Getting Things Done

[[Gettings Things Done]], or **GTD**, was a game-changer for me.

### Notes

- Choose a single source of truth for information
- Choose a single source of truth for data
- Use a common structure across data types and silos:
	- [[PARA Method]]
	- [[Johnney Decimal]]
	- [[LYT Framework]]
	- [[Dewey Decimal]]
	- etc.
- Use consistent naming conventions and automate what is automateable.
- Reduce number of storage locations
- Reduce number of tools used
- Rely on [[Open Source Software]] whenever possible
- Rely on [[Open Data Formats]] whenever possible
- Synchronize files across devices using automated tools and do not duplicate stuff manually
- Keep source data separate
- Work on copied *only after making copies/backups of the originals*
- Use a *single inbox for each type of data*:
	- Email Inbox
	- Videos Inbox
	- PodCasts Inbox
	- etc.
- Apply the [[Zero-Inbox Principal]] from [[GTD]] on all inboxes
- Be serious about backups and document/test backup strategy
- Avoid hoarding unnecessary content (see the [[Collectors Fallacy]]). 
- Learn to let go of the past

Most importantly, don't ruin your life trying to organize everything. Life is way too short for that. Design your own system and try to apply the Pareto principle. Organize what matters most, and don't feel bad about the rest.
