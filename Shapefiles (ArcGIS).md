# Shapefiles (ArcGIS)

## Overview

> [!QUOTE] Shapefile 
> A *shapefile* is an **Esri vector** data storage format for storing the *location, shape, and attributes of geographic features*. It is stored as a set of related files and contains one feature class. Shapefiles often contain large features with a lot of associated data and historically have been used in [[GIS]] desktop applications.

The primary way to make shapefile data available for others to view through a web browser is to add it to a .zip file, upload it, and publish a hosted feature layer. The .zip file must contain at least the .shp, .shx, .dbf, and .prj files components of the shapefile.

The following list summarizes how you can use shapefiles in ArcGIS Online and provides links to instructions:

- [Publish a hosted feature layer](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/manage-data/publish-features.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_B096C5A2239545CDA301A31C9A8819AE) from a shapefile (.zip).
- For hosted feature layers that have [export enabled](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/manage-data/manage-hosted-feature-layers.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_1CA88C296B3D4C4E94EAB92392DDDC0B), the people who have access to the hosted feature layer can [export the layer data to a shapefile](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/manage-data/use-hosted-layers.htm#GUID-47A1D795-B330-45D7-89F7-9203A99E6924).
- [Add shapefiles (in a .zip file) to My Content](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/manage-data/add-files-as-items.htm), and share the file with others so they can download it.
- Add a shapefile (.zip) as a layer to [Map Viewer Classic](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/add-layers.htm#FILE).
- Add a shapefile (.zip) to [Map Viewer](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/add-layers-from-file.htm) to publish a hosted feature layer and add it to the map.
